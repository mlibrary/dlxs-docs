        		December 5, 2003
        		<BR>
        		<BR>
       		 This month, the University of Michigan Library
        		will make	available release 11 of the DLXS software.
          		<SPAN>
          &nbsp;
     			 </SPAN>
          		In addition to a number of significant functional changes in the
          		software, release 11 will also include two new versions of XPAT.
          		<SPAN>
          &nbsp;
     			 </SPAN>
          		For active subscribers to DLXS, an initial beta release of a Unicode-capable
          		version of XPAT (
&quot;
          		xpatu&quot;
          ) will be	included in the licensed version of DLXS.
              <SPAN>
          &nbsp;
     			 </SPAN>
          However, freely available on the DLXS web site will also be a
&quot;lite&quot;
version of XPAT.
          <SPAN>
&nbsp;
		</SPAN>
		The XPAT lite search engine is capable of indexing source files up to 10
		megabytes in	size.
		<SPAN>
&nbsp;
		</SPAN>
		We hope that the DLXS distribution with XPAT lite software will be useful
		in several ways:</P>
        	<OL>
        		<LI>First, for many, the size limitation of 10Mb will not be a significant
        			impediment, and should allow them to use DLXS to provide access to
        			very	interesting digital library collections.
          			<SPAN>
          &nbsp;
          				</SPAN>
          			In this way, the XPAT lite software will combine with the open
          			source software development at Michigan to create
          			<I>an entirely	free version of DLXS</I>
          			<SPAN>.</SPAN>
     			 </LI>
        		<LI>There has been a pressing need, however, for some institutions
        			and smaller organizations to try DLXS before committing financial
        			resources.
          			<SPAN>
          &nbsp;
          				</SPAN>
          			This version of DLXS will also	function as a
&quot;demo&quot;
			
version.</LI>

        	<P CLASS="normaltext">Although we are not able to provide support to
        		users of the free DLXS using XPAT lite, (we will continue to limit
        		support for DLXS, as well as enhancement balloting, to active subscribers
        		to its support program), we are making available a listserv for users
        		of the free DLXS to share experiences and	tips.
