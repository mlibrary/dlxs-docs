        <hr width="75%"> <h3><a name="Overview"></a>OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p> The University of Michigan Digital Library eXtension Service (UM
           DLXS) offers a suite of resources designed to aid educational and
           non-profit institutions mount a variety of types of digital library
           collections. The University of Michigan conceived the SGML Server
           Program (SSP) in 1996 to serve a growing need for institutions like
           Michigan to put encoded text collections online. Since that time,
           a number of changes have taken place in the search engine marketplace,
           and the University of Michigan has strengthened its digital library
           production operations. The newly reconfigured UM DLXS replaces the
           SSP and offers both a search engine and a set of tools for mounting
           digital library resources. The search engine, XPAT, is specially designed
           to handle large and highly structured documents and metadata such
           as that found in digital library efforts. The tools that UM DLXS makes
           available are designed to tap the power of the XPAT engine for broad
           classes of resources consistent with digital library activities. The
           University of Michigan UM DLXS is a cost-recovery operation; fees
           charged by the UM DLXS are intended to cover ongoing development,
           maintenance, and support activities directly associated with the UM
           DLXS. <a name="_Toc455377995"></a><a name="_Toc458418346"></a></p>
        <a name="SearchEngine" id="SearchEngine"></a>
        <p></p>
        <h3> SEARCH ENGINE </h3>
        <p class="normaltext">The XPAT engine is an SGML/XML-aware search engine
           that the University of Michigan has deployed with an extremely diverse
           set of digital library resources. XPAT is based on the search engine
           previously marketed by Open Text as OT5(TM), and sometimes referred
           to as "Pat" and "Pat5.0." The University of Michigan has licensed
           the code in order to undertake distribution and support, as well as
           to add functionality. Because of XPAT's origins and the extent to
           which it has been employed in University of Michigan digital library
           projects, we are confident about the search engine's reliability,
           its core functionality, and many aspects of its scalability. As currently
           distributed, XPAT provides excellent support for word and phrase searching,
           indexing of SGML elements and attributes, basic valid and well-formed
           XML support (without Unicode), fast retrieval, and open systems integration.
           As part of the UM DLXS, the University of Michigan Digital Library
           Production Service has launched a continuous development process in
           which we hope to add a number of features to XPAT. The capabilities
           being pursued are: </p>
        <ul>
           <li>the addition of "regular expression" searching (e.g., internal
              wild-cards)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="normaltext">XPAT is licensed by the University of Michigan
           on a per-computer basis, with an initial one-time fee of $15,000 for
           the first instance of the search engine. <a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> Support
           for XPAT is available as part of the UM DLXS (see below); XPAT is
           also available without support. Please see below for pricing information. </p>
        <a name="Support" id="Support"></a> <h3> SUPPORT</h3>
        <p class="normaltext">Support for the XPAT engine is offered solely through
           membership in the UM DLXS. The XPAT engine is extremely versatile,
           and while documentation for a wide range of applications is provided
           as part of the licensing, the University of Michigan is only able
           to support those digital library applications undertaken within the
           Digital Library Production Service (DLPS) with the XPAT engine. Support
           (and pricing for support) for XPAT is designed around this core set
           of applications. The mechanisms for support are discussed further
           below. </p>
        <a name="ClassMiddleware" id="ClassMiddleware"></a> <h4> CLASS MIDDLEWARE </h4>
        <p class="normaltext">The UM DLXS distributes significant additional
           software as free, Open Source software. This DLXS software is based
           on the evolving DLXS content "classes." The UM DLXS seeks to enable
           digital library activities. To this end, significant resources are
           devoted to developing and supporting access mechanisms for many types
           of collections found in the digital library (e.g., page image based
           books with associated OCR, and SGML/XML encoded books and journals).
           Current classes include a class for monograph length books and journals
           (both modern and historical), a class for images and image metadata,
           a class for finding aids (available in a prototype form), and a class
           for bibliographic information. A large and growing set of behaviors
           (such as types of searches and browses) is applied to these classes.
           Both the classes and behaviors are being documented, and information
           is available online (see <a href="http://docs.dlxs.org/">http://docs.dlxs.org</a>).
           Middleware to support these classes and behaviors is distributed freely
           through the UM DLXS, and support for this middleware is provided as
           a component of an ongoing support contract. This class-based approach
           has replaced previous collection-specific middleware distributed by
           DLPS. DLPS is committed to a continuous process of developing this
           middleware, adding functionality as needs are identified and as the
           WWW matures as a delivery mechanism.</p>
        <a name="OnCallSupport" id="OnCallSupport"></a> <h4> ON-CALL SUPPORT</h4>
        <p class="normaltext">On-call support is provided primarily through e-mail,
           though telephone and postal contacts are provided for member institutions
           as well. A table of UM DLXS contacts is provided below. We typically
           provide an e-mail acknowledgement of all e-mail received at <a href="*" onMouseOver="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'l'+'x'+'s'+'-'+'h'+'e'+'l'+'p'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">DLXS
           Help</a> within 24-hours of receipt. We are not able to provide a
           timetable for resolution of problems, but we are sensitive to the
           fact that the tools and services made possible by the UM DLXS are
           used in production services, and that prompt resolution of problems
           is critical to the viability of these services. E-mail queries go
           to a group of staff members to ensure that problems are widely communicated,
           and that the most appropriate DLPS staff member receives the question.
           Office staff, who are more readily available, receive telephone queries
           and subsequently relay queries by e-mail to groups of staff to ensure
           a prompt and appropriate response. </p>
        <a name="Training" id="Training"></a> <h4> TRAINING </h4>
        <p class="normaltext">As a part of UM DLXS, the University of Michigan
           offers inexpensive workshops for participants, guiding programmers
           and digital collection managers in the application of the UM DLXS
           code base in putting collections online. Current plans (based on previous
           demand) are to offer these workshops at no charge, with transportation,
           food, and lodging being handled by the participants. We are able to
           accommodate one representative from each member institution for each
           workshop, but will consider special requests for more than one representative
           on a space-available basis. We will initially offer two workshops
           each year, one in the winter and one in the summer. More workshops
           will be offered based on demand. For more information, see <a href="../training/workshops.html">http://www.dlxs.org/training/workshops.html</a>. </p>
        <a name="#ReleaseSchedule" id="#ReleaseSchedule"></a> <h3> RELEASE SCHEDULE </h3>
        <p class="normaltext">We make every effort to deliver UM DLXS products
           to member institutions as quickly as possible while at the same time
           investing considerable energy in testing each product. We also solicit
           feedback from a number of user communities (including DLXS participants)
           to ensure that the products meet basic needs. We will continue to
           detail products and release schedules online at: <a href="../products/products.html">http://www.dlxs.org/products/products.html</a>.</p>
        <a name="Fees" id="Fees"></a> <h3> FEES</h3>
        <p class="normaltext">Costs to subscriber organizations will consist
           of one-time fees for the software license, and an ongoing cost for
           support as part of the UM DLXS. <b>A one-time cost of $15,000 is charged
           for licensing XPAT. </b> This entitles the subscribing institution
           to install XPAT on a single server. <a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Additional
           copies of the search engine will be available to the licensing institution
           at a reduced rate. <b>Support for the search engine will be charged
           at a rate of $5,000 per year</b>, regardless of the number of installations
           of the search engine. Support is made available to a single designated
           representative of the institution. The rate of $5,000 per year is
           applied to the first representative/membership within an institution;
           additional memberships within a single institution are charged at
           a lesser rate. <a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> Should an institution
           choose to discontinue participation in the UM DLXS, it may continue
           to use XPAT and is still bound by the terms of the license for the
           XPAT engine. An institution that has ceased its membership in UM DLXS
           may also keep middleware received under its membership, but is no
           longer entitled to updates of middleware or support for that middleware. </p>

        <a name="EligibleSubscribers" id="EligibleSubscribers"></a> <h3> ELIGIBLE
        SUBSCRIBERS FOR UM DLXS </h3>
        <p class="normaltext">The University of Michigan is legally entitled
           to sell the XPAT engine to other institutions or organizations in
           the "vertical market represented by other academic institutions and
           non-profit/not-for-profit organizations." As part of the process of
           purchasing the XPAT engine, an institution or organization will be
           required to provide evidence of its non-profit status (e.g., 501 (3c)
           certification). It is worth noting that while the XPAT engine is extremely
           versatile, the primary focus of the Digital Library Production Service
           is in creating and sustaining digital library applications, and thus
           the service will be focused on those applications. For example, DLPS's
           primary "classes" of resources (supported through the XPAT engine)
           are monographs (current and historical), bibliographic resources,
           and image collections; future efforts will focus on journals and encyclopedic
           reference works. We invite the participation of all types of non-profit
           organizations, but can best support those with missions consistent
           with those described here. </p>

        ENVIRONMENTS </h3>
        <p class="normaltext">The UM DLXS and XPAT are currently available for
           a number of popular UNIX environments. Participants must acquire and
           install server hardware and a web server (typically Apache), as well
           as Perl and some other open-source utilities. (Please see the document, <a href="http://docs.dlxs.org/intro/dlxs-sysreq.xml">DLXS
           System Requirements</a> for additional details.) We have a continuing
           commitment to supporting additional platforms and environments for
           XPAT and DLXS, but are not able to test all platforms, and hope we
           can work with DLXS partners to expand supported environments. Please

        <h3><a name="HostServices"></a> </h3><h3>HOST SERVICES </h3>
        <p class="normaltext">The University of Michigan Digital Library Production
           Service also offers host services for digital library collections.
           These services, previously a part of the SSP, are not a part of the
           UM DLXS. (The UM DLXS is oriented specifically to support local collection
           access mechanisms.) We would be pleased to discuss host services with
           interested institutions. Among the arrangements currently supported
           are fee-for-service host services for licensed collections, contract
           services for non-profit publishers wishing to disseminate publications
           on a subscription basis, and no-charge arrangements for hosting freely
           available digital library collections. For more information, please
