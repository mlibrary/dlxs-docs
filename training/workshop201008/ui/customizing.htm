<h2><a name="Figuring"></a>Figuring Out How  to Make a Change </h2>
<h3><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>Given the complexity of DLXS and the variety of options for making
    interface customizations, it can be difficult to determine how to make a
  change, let alone the the <em>best</em> way to make a change.</p>
<p>First of all, there are some  <a href="../troubleshooting/tools.html">web
    development tools</a> available  that can greatly simplify
  your effort. For now, get these three and keep the others in mind.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Firefox web browser</li>
  <li>Firebug extension for Firefox</li>
  <li>Web Developer extension for Firefox</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, get a little more familiar with the potential places customizations
  can be made. Listed below are the options, from simplest to most advanced.
  It probably goes without saying that you want to choose a simple option
  whenever possible. </p>

<p>Customization may require changes in more than one of the above areas. For
  example, you may need to change the XSL to add a class to an element so that
  you can change it's appearance in the browser using CSS. </p>
<h3><a name="pointers"></a>Pointers for deciding how to approach a user interface
  customization task. </h3>
<h4><a name="CollectionManager"></a>How to tell if the change can be made in <a href="http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/dlxs14/index.php/Working_with_the_Collection_Manager" target="_blank">Collection Manager</a></h4>
<ol>
  <li> Study the Collection Manager fields for the Class and Group, specifically
    looking for an option that would cause the desired change. Click the Collection
    Manager field labels for contextual help. Many fields apply to all classes,
    but each class has unique fields as well.</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="CSS"></a>How to tell if the change can be made with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) </h4>
<ol>
  <li>First of all, you need to have a basic understanding of what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css" target="_blank">CSS</a> is
    good for and how it works. </li>
  <li>Use the <a href="../troubleshooting/tools.html">Firebug</a> extension to Firefox to <em>inspect</em> the structure
    of the page including element class and id attributes. Firebug also 
    shows the styles that are currently affecting the element. In fact, you can
    even experiment with style definitions in Firebug. This should give you
    a very good idea of whether the change can be made with CSS, or not.</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="XSL"></a>How to tell if the change can be made with XSL</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Add debug=xml to the URL to view the XML for the page. Take a close look
    at the XML to see if the the information needed is present in the XML and
    structured in a way amenable to use with XSL. If the right information is
    in the XML, then XSL modifications will probably bring the desired change.</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="XML"></a>How to tell if a change can be made in an XML Template and/or Perl </h4>
<p>At this point, things get quite a bit more complicated. Often, changing
    the XML also means changing the Perl CGI and changing the XSL as well. In
    the best case, it is only a matter of shifting existing code around a little.
    For instance, the PI you need may exist  already and you just need to add
  it to the XML template for the page you are working on. </p>
<p>It would be appropriate at this point to contact DLXS Support with a question
  such as, &quot;I'm thinking about doing X, and I'm wondering if it is reasonable
  as well as what type of expertise would be needed to do the job.&quot;</p>
<p>However, if you are an experienced programmer, we encourage you to <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dlxs/training/workshop200707/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#misctech">use
    the Perl debugger to step through the code</a> to see what you can figure
    out on your own. If you think you see a solution, you might choose to contact
    DLXS Support to say, &quot;I'm thinking about doing X, and this is how I propose
    to do it. What do you think?&quot;. It is not that you need our blessing, but
    perhaps we can make a suggestion that would save you a lot of time, or difficulty. </p>
<p>Basically, at this level, you need to be a programmer comfortable with using
  the Perl debugger to step through a large body of object oriented code.</p>
<p>In general, it is not a bad idea to contact DLXS Support for
  guidance. Tell us what you are trying to do and a we'll be able to suggest
  the most reasonable approach. If you are not a programmer, you may need to
  find one. </p>
<h2 class="mainpalette"><a name="Correct"></a>Finding the Correct Files: More about Fallback</h2>
<h3><a name="XMLTemplate"></a>XML Template </h3>
<p>It can be difficult to locate the files that are directly involved in constructing
  an HTML page. Add <strong>debug=tpl</strong> to any DLXS URL for a report
  on the Fallback file selection process. The first file attempted will generally
  be the XML template file. In the example below, taken from the debug output, &quot;HIT&quot; tells
  us that the search.xml template was found in the class (t/text for Text Class)
  level web directory. </p>
<h4><font color="red">HIT</font>: standard template path: /n1/web/t/text/search.xml,
  xcollmode=singlecoll, on disk</h4>
<h3><a name="Chunks"></a>XML Template Chunks </h3>
<p>There is a special Processing Instruction called &quot;CHUNK&quot;. The CHUNK PI is
  for inserting a &quot;chunk&quot; of XML into the XML Template. Chunks are helpful where
  the same XML needs to occur in more than one XML Template. The best example
  is dlxsclassglobals.xml. This is an XML chunk that is used in just about every
  XML Template. When the chunk file is modified, all of the templates that use
  it automatically take advantage of the change, making maintenance easy. Keep
  in mind that chunks can contain PIs, including CHUNK PIs. </p>
<p>Fallback applies to CHUNKS too. A collection level chunk, if it exists and
  the situation is right, will be used instead of class or group level chunk.</p>
<p>&lt;DlxsGlobals&gt;&lt;?CHUNK filename=&quot;dlxsclassglobals.xml&quot;?&gt;&lt;/DlxsGlobals&gt;</p>
<h3><a name="XSLStylesheet"></a>XSL Stylesheet </h3>
<p>You will likely need to know which XSL files are being used. DLXS has a special
  way of linking XSL Stylesheets to XML files that allows for a lot of flexibility.
  The ability to make very specific customizations at the collection and group
  levels is extremely useful, but also introduces the potential for lots of XML
  and XSL to be duplicated needlessly. For example, you might be tempted to begin
  customizing a collection by first copying all of the class level web files
  to the collection's web directory (a very bad idea by the way). The best approach
  is to copy as little code as possible and rely on Fallback to draw together
  the proper set of files for a given situation.</p>
<p>Support for this  principle required development of a special method for specifying,
  locating, and importing one or more XSL Stylesheets for XML transformation
  to HTML. The <strong>Virtual XSL Stylesheet</strong> serves this purpose.</p>
<p>Each primary XML Template includes an <strong>XSL Fallback File
    List</strong> where XSL filenames are specified in import order. Paths are
    not necessary, because the Fallback mechanism will find the file at the collection,
    group or class level depending on the situation and the presence of files. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;XslFallbackFileList&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>bookbagitemsstring.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>search.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>htmlhead.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>navheader.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>footer.import.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>searchforms.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>xsl2htmlutils.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>globalvariables.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;Filename&gt;<strong>searchheader.xsl</strong>&lt;/Filename&gt;<br>
&lt;/XslFallbackFileList&gt; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All Fallback is handled by the Perl CGI. To build the <a href="search_virtualstylesheet.xml">Virtual
    XSL Stylesheet (example)</a>, the CGI parses the XSL Fallback File List, performs Fallback on
  each file, and assembles a list of XSL import statements. </p>
<p>Here you can see the import statements from the Virtual XSL Stylesheet the
  CGI builds. In this case, all of the files are in the class level web directory.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/bookbagitemsstring.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/search.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/htmlhead.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/navheader.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/footer.import.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/searchforms.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/lib/xsl2htmlutils.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/globalvariables.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;<strong>/n1/web/t/text/searchheader.xsl</strong>&quot;/&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The order of the import statements is significant. The <strong>first</strong> import &quot;wins&quot; in
  cases where an XSL template (don't confuse XSL templates with XML templates)
  of the same name occurs in more than one file. This feature allows XSL template
  overrides to occur in a logical fashion. <strong>This
  is very important concept to understand. </strong>Imagine you want to customize
  the search form for a single collection and that the change requires modification
  to 
  <em>just one</em> of several XSL <em>templates</em> that exist in the Class level search.xsl
  file. Here are the steps you should take.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a collection specific web directory, if one does not already exist.</li>
  <li>Create an XSL file called search.xsl in the collection specific web
    directory and include in it just the template(s) requiring modification.
    You probably want to copy the single template from the Class level XSL search.xsl
    file. </li>
  <li>Add an import statement to the collection level search.xsl file that imports
    the Class level file.</li>
  <li>Modify the collection level template to your liking.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Virtual Stylesheet is assembled, Fallback will find the collection
  level search.xsl file and import it. This will in-turn cause the Class level
  search.xsl file to be imported too, <em>except</em> the modified collection level template
  will be used since it was imported first. </p>
<h3><a name="Oxygen"></a>Oxygen for Dissecting XML and XSL</h3>
<p><strong>Oxygen</strong> is an application for editing and debugging XML and XSL (see also <a href="../troubleshooting/tools.html">web
    development tools</a>).
  It also does XSL transformations so you clearly see the relationship among
  the XML, XSL and the resulting HTML. Oxygen enables you
  to step through the transform, but even better, you can click on an element
  in the HTML output and it will show you the XML and XSL that generated it.
  What a powerful timesaver!</p>
<p>To make the most effective use of Oxygen, you should use an XWindows server
  to run it remotely on the DLXS server. This provides direct access to all
  of the XML and XSL files. Adding <strong>debug=xsltwrite</strong> to a DLXS
  URL will cause the CGI to write the Virtual XSL Stylesheet and the populated
  XML files to disk in <strong>$DLXSROOT/web/cache</strong>. Open these files in Oxygen, and transform
  the Virtual XSL Stylesheet to the XML. Oxygen will find and open the imported
  XSL files allowing you to make edits and rerun the transform. </p>
<h3><a name="LanguageMap"></a>Language Map</h3>
<p>All text that appears as part of the user interface is stored in an XML file
  per Class called <strong>langmap.en.xml</strong>. Phrases are assigned keys, and the keys are
  used in the XSL to retrieve phrases. </p>
<p>Customization of the Language Map requires finding the key and phrase that
  needs to be changed. There are a couple of ways to go at this. You can open
  the Language Map file and search for the phrase, or you can locate the associated
  key in the XSL and then look for the key in Language Map. Once the key and
  phrase have been identified, it is recommended that you create a <strong>langmapextra.en.xml</strong>  file and make your changes there. </p>
<p>For example, if you need to change the word &quot;login&quot; to &quot;sign in&quot; for all Text
  Class collections, do the following.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open $DLXSROOT/web/t/text/langmap.en.xml and locate the term &quot;login&quot;. There
    may be several occurrences, but you confirm three are relevant by grepping
    the XSL files for the keys. Here are the three. <br>
    <br>
    <span class="markupsnippet style1">&lt;Item key=&quot;standardlogin.str&quot;&gt;<strong>Login</strong>&amp;#xa0;&lt;/Item&gt;<br>
&lt;Item key=&quot;header.str.login&quot;&gt;<strong>Login</strong> &lt;/Item&gt;<br>
&lt;Item key=&quot;results.str.9&quot;&gt;<strong>Login</strong> for full access
to this item&lt;/Item&gt; <br>
  </span></li>
  <li>Create a new file in the Text Class web directory called <strong>langmapextra.en.xml</strong> containing
    the following text. The &quot;Lookup id&quot; value is arbitrary. &quot;auth&quot; is used here
    just to be consistent with what appears in <strong>langmap.en.xml</strong>. <br>
    <br>
  <span class="markupsnippet style1">&lt;LookupTables&gt;<br>
  &lt;Lookup id=&quot;auth&quot;&gt;  <br>
  </span><span class="markupsnippet style1">&lt;Item key=&quot;standardlogin.str&quot;&gt;<strong>Sign
        In</strong>&amp;#xa0;&lt;/Item&gt;<br>
&lt;Item key=&quot;header.str.login&quot;&gt;<strong>Sign In</strong> &lt;/Item&gt;<br>
&lt;Item key=&quot;results.str.9&quot;&gt;<strong>Sign In</strong> for full
  access to this item&lt;/Item&gt;<br>
  &lt;/Lookup&gt;<br>
  &lt;/LookupTables&gt;
  </span></li>
</ol>
<p>That's all it takes. The DlxsGlobals.xml chunk file already specifies that
  <strong>langmapextra.en.xml</strong> be loaded if present. Item keys in it
  trump items with the same keys  in <strong>langmap.en.xml</strong>. To limit
  the changes to a specific group or collection, place the <strong>langmapextra.en.xml</strong>  file in the collection or group level web directory. </p>
<p>It is possible to use Language Maps to create a multi-lingual user
  interface. </p>
