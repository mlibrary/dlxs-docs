<H3 CLASS="sectionheader"> Build the XPAT Index using the Makefile </H3> 
<P>The Makefile in the <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">bin</SPAN> directory contains
   the commands necessary to build the index, and can be executed easily.</P> 
<P>To create an index for use with the Findaid Class interface, you will need
   to index the words in the collection, then index the XML (the structural metadata,
   if you will), and then finally "fabricate" structures based on a combination
   of elements (for example, defining what the "main title " is: the text between
   open &lt;origination&gt; tag and the closing &lt;/unittitle&gt; tag). </P> 
<P><strong>What to do: </strong></P> 
<P>After editing the variables at the top of the Makefile (DLXSROOT, NAMEPREFIX, and FIRSTLETTERSUBDIR), the  commands listed below can be given at the command line to prepare
   the data and make the varioius indexes needed by XPAT.</P> 

<P>The first time you index a new collection, we reccommend that you follow the following procedure:
<ul>
<li>Run each of the steps listed below in sequence</li>
<li>After each step, check the error files or standard output for any errors</li>
<li>If there are any errors, fix the problem and redo the step until there are no errors, prior to moving on to the next step</li>
</ul>
</P>

<P><b>Standard Commands</b></P>
<ol>
<li><P><b>make validateeach </b> validates the individual ead2002 XML files against
   the ead2002 DTD </P> 

<li><P><b>make prepdocs </b> removes the XML and DOCTYPE declarations, changes IDs
   to be unique across all files, and concatenates all the XML files into one,
   wrapping all the <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">ead</SPAN> elements in a <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">COLL</SPAN> element.  It also contains some "Bentley Specific" processing, especially for DAO's that you may want to change. 
</P>
 
<li><P><b>make validate</b> validates the new, concatenated file against the dlxsead2002
   DTD </P> 

<li><P><b>make singledd</b> indexes the full text of the full file </P> 

<li><P><b>make xml </b> indexes the XML structure while at the same time validating.
   The use of <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">xmlrgn</SPAN> by this command is slower
   than <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">multirgn</SPAN> because of this validation.</P> 

<li><P><b>make post</b> builds and indexes fabricated regions based on the XPAT queries
   stored in the <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">samplefa.extra.srch</SPAN> file.</P> 
</ol>


<P>
After you have made any changes necessary to index without errors, when adding records to the index you may want to run a command that runs all the steps.  That command is <b>make all</b>.  If running <b>make all</b> results in errors, you should run <b>make clean</b>, which will remove all the index and prep files, and then run the steps one by one in order to determine the source of the errors.
</P>
<P><b>Convenience Commands</b></P>
<P><b>make all</b> runs all the above commands</P>
<P><b>make prepdocslist</b> same as <b>make prepdocs</b> but reads the file <b>"list_of_eads"</b> in the data directory to get the list of eads to index in a specific order instead of just indexing all the xml files in the data directory in ascii alpha order. </P>
<P><b>make allbutprep</b> runs all the steps except for  <b>make prepdocs</b>.
 This is useful if you run <b>make prepdocslist</b> instead of <b>make prepdocs</b> </P>

<P><b>make clean</b> removes all created temporary prep and index files so you can start over</P>
