    <H2><A NAME="top"></A>DLPS DLXS Development Environment Scenarios </H2>
    <P>Here are various scenarios to illustrate how we use CVS, multiple rows
      in the dlxs database, multiple servers (development, production and data
      prep machines), and rdist to manage all aspects of code development, deployment
      and release. Follow along with <A HREF="DevEnvironmentDiagram.jpg" TARGET="examples">this
      diagram</A> in a separate window.</P>
    <P>As you read through the scenarios, keep in mind the following about the
       development environment at DLPS: </P>
    <UL>
       <LI>each developer has their <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">$DLXSROOT</SPAN> set
                to <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/dev/username/</SPAN> by their login
                script.</LI>
       <LI>each developer has their virtual host Apache configuration set the <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">$DLXSROOT</SPAN> environment
                      variable for use in the browser</LI>
       <LI>all machines have XPat installed</LI> 
       <LI>all machines have the dlxs daemon running to allow remote access to
          XPat indexes and data\</LI>
       <LI>each developer has their own row in the dlxs database for each collection
          and group which is their own personal, alterable &quot;copy&quot; of the &quot;release&quot;
          (dlxsadm) and &quot;production&quot; rows. </LI>
    </UL>

    <H3><A NAME="scenario1" ID="scenario1"></A> 
      <SPAN CLASS="sectionheader">Scenario 1: one developer changing code, testing,
      and committing changes </SPAN></H3>
    <P>Developer <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">pagliere</SPAN> works on a file in
       his own sandbox or &quot;dev space&quot;, <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/dev/pagliere/cgi/t/text/TextClass.pm</SPAN>.
       Since his virtual host <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">http://pagliere.dev.umdl.umich.edu/</SPAN> sets
       his <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">$DLXSROOT</SPAN>       to <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/dev/pagliere</SPAN>,
       all his middleware uses modules such as <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/dev/pagliere/cgi/t/text/TextClass.pm</SPAN>       and
       /<SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">l1/dev/pagliere/lib/DlpsUtils.pm</SPAN>, etc.
       He tests his code. He decides it is self-consisitent and working. He runs
       <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">cvs commit</SPAN> or the DLPS script <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">commitme
       pagliere text</SPAN> or uses his <em>xemacs
       cvs-mode</em> to commit his changes to the repository. </P>
    <P>The next time other developers cvs update their own dev spaces (see <A HREF="#scenario2">Scenario
       2</A>), they will have <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">pagliere's</SPAN> code merged
       into theirs. </P>
    <H3><A NAME="scenario2" ID="scenario2"></A> <SPAN CLASS="sectionheader">Scenario
    2: updating a developer's code with the latest changes</SPAN></H3>
    <P>Developer <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">pfarber</SPAN> runs <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">cvs
          update</SPAN> or
       the DLPS script <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">updateme pfarber all</SPAN> or
       uses xemacs in cvs-mode to cvs update code in his own dev
       space. All changes that were committed to the repository are merged into
       <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">pfarber's</SPAN> code.</P>
    <H3><A NAME="scenario3" ID="scenario3"></A> <SPAN CLASS="sectionheader">Scenario
    3: data update, testing of new data and move to production</SPAN></H3>
    <P>Developer <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">sooty</SPAN> receives new data for
       a collection. She deposits it in the <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/prep/c/coll</SPAN> on
       the data prep machine. She adjusts all her prep scripts, runs them, and
       creates new data files in <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/obj/c/coll</SPAN>       and
       corresponding indexes in <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/idx/c/coll</SPAN>.
       She opens <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">collmgr</SPAN>, and changes her own
       row in the dlxs database so that the <em>host</em> field points to the
       development machine. When she runs her code, through the browser or the
       debugger, all requests for data via XPat will go to the development machine
       and its new data.</P>
    <P>When she is satisfied that the new data is working correctly, she <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">rdist</SPAN>s
       the <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/obj/c/coll</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/idx/c/coll</SPAN> directories
       over to the production machine (and, if necessary, to the development
       machine). She changes the value of the host field back to the production
       machine, if she desires. </P>
    <H3><A NAME="scenario4" ID="scenario4"></A>Scenario 4: updating the &quot;release&quot; directory
             to test multiple developers' changes</H3>
    <P>Several developers have been working on different parts of the code, merging
       (via <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">cvs update</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">cvs
       commit</SPAN>) their code with the repository's latest/ever-changing
       code. One developer runs a DLPS script called <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">updaterelease</SPAN>.
       which <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">cvs updates</SPAN> the so-called <em>release</em> directories,<SPAN CLASS="unixcommand"> /l1/cgi/</SPAN>
       and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/lib/</SPAN>
       and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/web</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/lib</SPAN>,
       etc. General testing is done by everyone in the <em>release</em> area. </P>
    <H3><A NAME="scenario5" ID="scenario5"></A>Scenario 5: moving latest code
    to production </H3>
    <P>After the release area's code is tested and felt to be working properly,
       a <em>build production package </em> script is run which gathers up the
       latest versions of all the (<SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/cgi/</SPAN>
       and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/lib/</SPAN>
       and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/web</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/lib</SPAN>,
       etc.) and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">rdist</SPAN>s it all to the production
       machine.</P>
 
  <H3><A NAME="scenario6" ID="scenario6"></A>Scenario 6: tagging and releasing a DLXS
             Release </H3>
    <P>After code has been running for a certain length of time in production
       and it is decided to release to the DLXS community an official DLXS Middleware
       Release, a <em>build       release package </em> script
       is run which gathers up the latest versions of all the (<SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/cgi/</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/lib/</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/web</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">/l1/lib</SPAN>,
    etc.), cvs tags it all and places it in a particular directory on the development
       machine so that it can all be burned to CD.</P>
