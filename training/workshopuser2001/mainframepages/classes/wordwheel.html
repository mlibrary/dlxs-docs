<P>For collections that have valid text (corrected OCR or proofed input), a &quot;wordwheel&quot; 
  can be created. The XPat indexed text is used by a script to build an index, 
  with counts of occurrences, of individual words that appear in various regions 
  (main text or author or title fields). This data is packaged into SGML and indexed 
  with XPat. The Wordwheel program is then used to access this data. All of this 
  allows a user to &quot;browse&quot; through and find words that may be similar 
  to a word s/he is looking for.</P>
