<H3> Query Language Details</H3>

This is some additional, extremely detailed information on XPat. 
<P>

<HR width="50%">

<H4>

Special commands that generate point sets:</H4>



<DL><TT>"a".."c"</TT>

<BR><TT>"198"~"199"</TT>

<DD>

This is a range searching command, find all "words" that begin with letters

ranging from a to c for the first example, or all words that begin with

the numbers ranging from 198 to 199 in the second example.</DD>



<DT>

<TT>shift.# A</TT></DT>



<DD>

Make a new point set consisting of all the points that are #bytes to the

right of all the start byte offsets of set A (a negative number shifts

to the left). A can be a region or point set, the result set is always

demoted to a point set.</DD>

</DL>



<HR width="50%"><A NAME="Operators"></A>

<H4>

Operators and Relations:</H4>

More discussion of the operators in detail concerning the types of sets

that result

<BR>when the operator is applied to region sets, point sets, or a combination.

In addition,

<BR>some of the extended forms of the operators are discussed.

<DL>

<DT>

<B><TT>A ^ B</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

the "and" or "intersection" operator: A and B are two sets, or expressions

that evaluate to sets, and the resulting set includes those points or regions

in both A and B that have the exact same start offsets. It makes little

sense to "and" together two point sets, unless those two point sets contain

heterogenous members. "and"-ing on two region sets can be spectacularly

useful. "and"-ing together a point and a region set has the interesting

property that it seems to inherit "regionness".</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A - B</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

the "minus" or "difference" operator. A and B are both sets, the resulting

set is those members of A that do not share the same start offset with

any member of B. This behaves much the same as the ^ operator in terms

of how appropriate it is to points or regions.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A + B + C + ...</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

the "or" or "union" operator: A, B, C... are sets, the resulting set is

a point set if at least one of the sets being combined is a point set,

consisting of the start offsets of all the points or regions in the original

sets. If <I>all</I> the sets being combined are region sets, then regions

that nest inside other listed regions (either entirely or at their start

byte offset) will be removed from the resultant set. If we were to + together

all the P and B regions in an HTML database, for instance, all the B elements

nested inside P elements would be removed, leaving just the P's and B's

not in P. I question the utility of this behavior, and search strategies

the SSP platform takes will be later seen to avoid this at all costs.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A incl B</TT></B></DT>



<BR><B><TT>A incl.# B</TT></B>

<BR><B><TT>A not incl B</TT></B>

<DD>

A is a region set, B is either point or region, the result is a region

set of all members of A that contain at least one member of B, containment

meaning that a given B has a start offset within the inclusive range of

a given A's start and end offsets. The alternative form allows a number

# of the least number of B's that must be contained in an A. incl can take

the not operator to return all A's that don't have any B's (without a #

argument), or all A's that don't have # or more B's.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A within B</TT></B></DT>



<BR><B><TT>A not within B</TT></B>

<DD>

In many ways the complement to incl: A is a point or region set, B is a

region set, the resulting set is all members of A that are contained (by

the start offset rule as under incl) in any B. This also takes the not

operator to return all A's that are not within any B.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A near B</TT></B></DT>



<BR><B><TT>A near.# B</TT></B>

<BR><B><TT>A not near B</TT></B>

<BR><B><TT>A not near.# B</TT></B>

<DD>

A and B are either points or regions, and # is either explicitly stated,

or taken from the <TT>{proximity}</TT> setting (see about <TT><A href="#settings">{settings}</A></TT>

below). The result is all A's whose start offsets are within the specified

number of bytes of the start offset of any B. The not form returns all

A's whose start offsets are not within the specified number of bytes from

the start offset of any B. The nearest B might be earlier or later in the

source file.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A fby B</TT></B></DT>



<BR><B><TT>A fby.# B</TT></B>

<BR><B><TT>A not fby B</TT></B>

<BR><B><TT>A not fby.# B</TT></B>

<DD>

This is just as the near operator, save that an A must be followed within

the specified number of bytes by a B to be in the result set. This also

takes the not operator.</DD>



<DT>

<B>not</B></DT>



<DD>

This reverses the sense of the expression it modifies, usable with incl,

within, near, and fby.</DD>

<H4>

Using the Operators to Make Sets of Interest</H4>

Now that we have our basic concepts and operators, let's get in there and

do some searching and <I>document analysis</I>: the process by which we

figure out what is there and <B>how the DTD was applied to this SGML</B>,

and <B>what of it we can use</B>. When developing an online system, this

is the most important step. Some important commands will be introduced

in this experimentation.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE:</B> All the search and set identification strategies

from here on out are heavily influenced by what SSP content-specialists

and developers have cared about over the years. I will not claim that this

is the only way to go about searching or retrieving text.</BLOCKQUOTE>

What a <I>set of interest</I> is is entirely up to the user, and the notion of 
user ranges from developers to content specialists to the patrons floating around 
out there. I'm going to walk through some increasingly complicated possible sets 
of interest here. These examples speak to the concept of fabricated regions, which 
are more the domain of the content-specialist.. 
<DL> 
  <DT> <I>find all the words that start with "diff", and find all the words that 
    are "different" exactly</I></DT>

    and that poems themselves are POEM elements in the sgml</DT>

    to know that the CBEL element contains information about publication and authorship, 
    and that a given CBEL element lives in a POETGRP element, which will contain 
    all the poems by a single poet. We also need to know what will show up in 
    the CBEL element (this last bit skips ahead to displaying sets).</DT>
  <PRE>>> region POEM within (region POETGRP incl (region CBEL incl "1801-1850"))

    example here from DAAP, POEM has a required GENDER attribute, which takes 
    "male" or "female" as a value)</DT>

  <I>[why does 37 work? what kind of set results here?]</I> 
  <DT> <I>We want to find stanzas that follow stanzas that use the word "pie"</I></DT>
  <P><BR>
    This is a trick question; there is no way, using the commands and sgml region 
    relationships given, to express this relationship <I>within XPat</I>. Siblinghood, 
    and immediate parent-child relationships cannot be conclusively established 
    in XPat. One needs to ask some questions of XPat, massage the answers, and 
    then feed them back in as a second layer of questions to get at these kinds 
    of relationships. 
  <P>One way would be to try something like this: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <PRE>>> "&lt;/stanza" within (region STANZA incl "pie ")

&nbsp; 40: 99 matches

>>&nbsp;



## print out that point set, add the length of the text

## "/STANZA>" (8) to each offset, and submit

## those back to OT as searches such as (assuming that 26644 was a

## result in the above search set 40):



>> region STANZA ^ [26652]

&nbsp; 41: one match

>></PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  Another way might be something like this: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE> 
    <PRE>>> "&lt;/stanza" within (region STANZA incl "pie ")

&nbsp; 42: 99 matches

>> shift.8 42

&nbsp; 43: 99 matches

>> region STANZA ^ 43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp; 44: 81 matches

>></PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  Wait just a minute! I thought we said this couldn't be done <I>within XPat</I>! 
  Doesn't this give us the exact same thing as the first suggestion: all STANZA's 
  that follow a STANZA with "pie*"? Yes, it should give us the same thing. I'm 
  going to stick by my claim that there is no way to do this within XPat because 
  the last stunt above (and even the first stunt, now that I mention it) depend 
  utterly on: 
  <UL>
    <LI> the knowledge we have about the length of the open tag for STANZA</LI>
    <LI> that there is nothing like a PI or PB or some such other intervening 
      nonsense sibling</LI>
  </UL>
  A better strategy might be to modify the first suggestion to: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><TT>("&lt;/stanza" within (region STANZA incl "pie ")) fby.15 "&lt;STANZA"</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
  And home in on the following stanzas that way. Or at least hope that 15 is a 
  good number.</DL>
