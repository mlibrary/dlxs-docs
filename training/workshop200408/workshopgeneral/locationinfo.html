<P><strong>Airport Ground Transportation</strong>:There is a long, sad history with shuttle service
   to and from the Detroit airport. The Ann Arbor visitors page lists several
   shuttle services, but they seem to come and go like a summer breeze. The most
   reliable method is taxi service, which costs about $45-50 each way.</P>
<P><strong>Parking</strong>, as on most college campuses, is a constant source of frustration.
   Information on visitor parking, with maps, is available at:<BR>

Information </A></P>
<P><strong>Hotels</strong>: As you might expect, the hotels within walking distance
   to campus (Bell Tower, Campus Inn, Michigan League) are also the most expensive.
   There are several hotels out by the Briarwood Mall that are less expensive,
but would be a good hike on foot. There is public transportation,
   the <A HREF="http://www.theride.org">Ann Arbor Transit Authority</A> close
   by. The #36 bus is a shuttle from &quot;Wolverine Tower,&quot; and runs every
   15 minutes or so till 6pm, then every 30 minutes till10pm. The fare is $1.00
each way.</P>
