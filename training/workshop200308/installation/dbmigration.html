   <P>
             For initial installations, if you chose MySQL for your database,
 use <A HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/collmeta/dlxs-dbmove.xml">$DLXSROOT/bin/db/dbmove</A>
 to move the sample CSV database into your MySQL database before you try
to  run the sample data.  This assumes you have configured a MySQL database
as described in the <A
 HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/intro/dlxs-install.xml#mysqlconfig">MySQL database
configuration documentation</A>.     
   </P>
   <H3><A NAME="dbconversion"></A>Database conversion</H3>
   <P>
             If you are installing DLXS for the first time, database conversion is not
 an issue.     
   </P>
   <P>
             If you have a Release 9 DLXS installation, an upgrade utility called
 <B><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier, mono">upgrade_2_3</FONT></B> in $DLXSROOT/bin/db
 can be used to update your version 2 database to version 3.  See documentation
 on database functionality for <A
 HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/collmeta/dlxs-upgrade.xml">complete instructions</A>.
</P>
   <P>
             If you have a Release 8 DLXS installation, an upgrade utility called
 <B><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier, mono">upgrade_1_2</FONT></B> in $DLXSROOT/bin/db
 can be used to update your version 1 database to version 2.  See documentation
 on database functionality for <A
 HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/collmeta/dlxs-upgrade.xml">complete instructions</A>.
   </P>
   <P>
      If you have a DLXS installation that predates release 8, a conversion
 utility called <B><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier, mono">dbconv</FONT></B>
 in $DLXSROOT/bin/db can be used to capture the data in your existing colldb
 files and merged into the CSV tables located in DlXSROOT/misc/db.  See documentation
 on database functionality for <A
 HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/collmeta/dlxs-dbconv.xml">complete instructions</A>.<BR>
   </P>
   <H3><A NAME="dbinstall"></A>Having two database installed to support two
 DLXS versions</H3>
   <P>
      Be aware of the following:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 8 of DLXS uses version 1 of the database.<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 9 of DLXS uses version 2 of the database<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 10 of DLXS uses version 3 of the database.<BR>
 <BR>
 Therefore, if you have version 8 or 9 of DLXS and have installed version 10 of 
DLXS, you will need to get a database version 3 set up to use with your DLXS 
version 10 installation.<BR>
 <BR>
 How should you go about doing this? Here are a few strategies to help 
you decide what to do:<BR>
 <B><BR>
 1. Say you have version 8 of DLXS using version 1 of a CSV database, 
and you want to create a version 3 CSV database to run with a DLXS 10 
installation.</B><BR>
 <BR>
 If you do not have too many collections, you may just want to go though
<SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">collmgr</SPAN> and change the database that way.<BR>
 <BR>
 If this is not feasible, copy your CSV tables from version 8 ($DLXSROOT/misc/db,
where $DLXSROOT is the environment variable you used for version 8) to the CSV dir for version 10
($DLXSROOT/misc/db, $DLXSROOT is the one you used for version 10).
Then run the upgrade scripts on the just copied files. To go from DLXS
8 to DLXS 10 you will need to run <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">upgrade_1_2 -d CSV</SPAN>, and then <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">upgrade_2_3
-d CSV</SPAN>. See <A HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/collmeta/dlxs-upgrade.xml">complete
instructions</A>      on the upgrade scripts.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 2. Say you have version 8 of DLXS using version 1 of a CSV database, 
and you want to create a version 3 of a MySQL database to run with a DLXS 
10 installation.</B><BR>
 <BR>
 In this case you could follow the instructions presented in 1, and then run
<BR>
 <BR>
 <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">$DLXSROOT/bin/db/dbmove -s CSV -t MySQL</SPAN><BR>
 <BR>
 This will move your CSV database into a MySQL database. &nbsp;Of course, 
a MySQL database needs to exists with the appropriate permissions. See <A
 HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/intro/dlxs-install.xml#mysqlconfig">MySQL database
configuration documentation</A> for more details.     <BR>
 <BR>
 You could also move the database 1st and then run the upgrade scripts.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 3. &nbsp;Say you have version 8 of DLXS using version 1 of a MySQL database, 
and you want to create a version 3 of a MySQL database to run with a DLXS 
10 installation.</B><BR>
 <BR>
 In this case, the easiest thing would be to start up MySQL with the root password 
and copy your database version 1 to the name you gave it when you installed
DLXS 10. Then run the upgrade scripts on the copy of the database. Unfortunately,
you cannot copy a database with MySQL. This is a feature MySQL is thinking
of adding, but it is not available yet. To view a list of features
to be added to MySQL, check <A
 HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/TODO_future.html">the MySQL web site</A>.<BR>
 <BR>
 What we would suggest is that you dump your version 1 of the MySQL database 
into a dir and then load that data into a newly created database. &nbsp;Note
that you may want to delete some entries in the sessions table before dumping
the database into the directory since this table tends to get very large.
&nbsp;After this is done you can run the upgrade scripts on the newly created
database. &nbsp;<BR>
 <BR>
 Here are the steps to dump one database,  create a new database, and popultate it with the data dumped from the first:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>
 From Unix prompt, make sure you have given
DUMPDIR write permissions (you can also do this to backup the db):<BR>
shell&gt;<SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">mysqldump -u root -p --tab=DUMPDIR dlxs</SPAN><BR>
 </LI>
 <LI>
Go into mysql as root and create the database<BR>
mysql&gt; <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">create database dlxs10;</SPAN><BR>
</LI>
      <LI>
Create the tables in the new database<BR>
 shell&gt; <SPAN CLASS="unixcommand">cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql -u root -p dlxs10</SPAN><BR>
</LI>
      <LI>Now load the data in the database.<BR>
 shell&gt;<SPAN CLASS="unixcommand"> mysqlimport -u root -p dlxs10 DUMPDIR/*.txt</SPAN><BR>
 </LI>
 </OL>
