<P>OAIster takes its name from the OAI harvesting protocol. See <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/" TARGET="external">http://www.openarchives.org/</A> 
  for more information on the protocol. </P>
<P>OAIster uses this protocol to harvest records that have been served by various 
  institutions. For instance, OAIster is able to harvest the metadata provided 
  by the Library of Congress for their American Memory Project. Folks who come 
  to use OAIster are able to search this metadata and link directly to the digital 
  representation linked to from the metadata.</P>
<P>To search OAIster (and for a lot more information) see <A HREF="http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/" TARGET="external">http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/</A>. 
  Try searching for "pennsylvania" in the Keyword field and "railroad" in the 
  Subject field.</P>

<P>Would you like to make your digital representations more widely available? 
  We can include your digital collections in OAIster, however, we need to have 
  you OAI-enable your metadata first.</P>
<P>This is fairly simple using the "broker" application that comes with the newest 
  CD Release. To find out in detail how to setup broker, go to <A HREF="http://docs.dlxs.org/collmeta/dlxs-broker.xml" TARGET="external">http://docs.dlxs.org/collmeta/dlxs-broker.xml</A>.</P>
<P>Once you have broker setup for your institution, go to <A HREF="http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/cgi-bin/Explorer/oai1.1/testoai>http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/cgi-bin/Explorer/oai1.1/testoai</A>.  This is the OAI - Repository Explorer website, which contains test tools to test out implementations of the OAI 1.1 protocol.  You can register broker here and test it.</P>

<P>If you have been able to successfully register and test broker from the Repository Explorer website, you can then try to officially register it at <A HERF="http://www.openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider1.1.html" TARGET="external"">http://www.openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider1.1.html</A>. 
  openarchive.org will send you an email letting you know if broker registered 
  successfully.</P>
