		to ensure that the nomenclatures have been changed appropriately.</P>

		and your encoding practices, can do the intellectual work required to convert
		the texts. You should do this with the tools you are most comfortable using,
		whether they be macros in your favorite editor, perl scripts if you have strong
		programming skills, OmniMark if you like that, or XSLT (my personal choice). We
		have a fairly detailed XSLT strategy on the documentation website, which uses
		freely-available or ubiquitous tools, and if you are creating XML documents
		anyway, this might be a reasonable route to pursue. </P> 
	 <P CLASS="mainpalette">We have also used a perl script to do conversions of
		TEI Lite-encoded SGML into Text Class SGML, and are willing to make these
		(largely undocumented) scripts available. We are happy to offer suggestions and
		our historical experience in converting collections, but cannot really support
		you with specific tools or methods in your conversion, as it is particular to
		the encoding of your texts.</P> 
	 <P CLASS="mainpalette">For today, we are going to be working with some
		texts that are already in Text Class, and one file that is in a DTD based on
		TEI Lite. We will be building them into a collection we are going to call
		<B>workshoptc</B>.</P> 
	 <P CLASS="mainpalette">This documentation will make use of the concept of
		the $DLXSROOT, which is the place at which your DLXS directory structure
		starts. We generally use /l1/, but for the workshop, we each have our own
		$DLXSROOT in the form of /l1/workshop/userX. To determine what your $DLXSROOT

		created in the form $DLXSROOT/obj/d/l/p/dlpsid (the DLPS ID can consist of a

		(dd) individually. Seems like a good idea -- no redundant copies of files! --
		but searching is slower than an index built of concatenated files. Also, if any
		one of the files referenced changes in any way, the entire index fails. We no
		longer use MFS indexes ourselves for this reason. If you'd like to try this on
		your own, note that this is pointing to the obj directories for the individual
		texts, and does not include the fifth file we edited yesterday. You'd want to
		point to your normalized texts in $DLXSROOT/prep/w/workshoptc/data <B>or</B>
		rename those and copy them out to their individual $DLXSROOT/obj/x/y/z
		directories.</P>

	 <P CLASS="mainpalette">Map files take language that is used in the forms
		and translates it into language for the cgi and for XPAT. For example, if you
		want your users to be able to search within chapters, you would need to add a
		mapping for how you want it to appear in the search interface (case is
		important, as is pluralization!), how the cgi variable would be set (usually
		all caps, and not stepping on an existing variable), and how XPAT will identify
		and retrieve this natively.</P> 
	 <P CLASS="mainpalette">The first part of the file is operator mapping, for
		the form, the cgi, and XPAT. The second part is for region mapping, as in the
