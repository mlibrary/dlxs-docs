<P>On the CD-ROM you will find a number of tarfiles, a Perl program called Installer.pl 

  and a configuration file called main.cfg. </P>



<P>There are two methods to do the install:</P>



<UL>

   <LI>Run the installation directly from the CD. This method will

   install the entire distribution.

   

   <LI>Copy the Installer files and (some or all) tarfiles to a

   directory and run the install from that directory. Then the

   installer will install only the tarfiles present in the directory.



</UL>



<P>If you do a selective install you must install at least one Class,

Collmgr and Lib tarfiles to have a working system.</P>



<H2><A NAME="process"></A>The install process</H2>



<P>There are 3 parts to installing DLXS. The install step (among other things) 

  sets the values of a number of Perl variables found in the following.cfg files. 

  These variables may be changed manually at a later time. The goal of the install 

  is to create an initial working system that can function using the sample collection 

  data. There are a number of <I>other</I> Perl variables in the .cfg files which 

  affect functionality but are not critical to establish a working system which 

  you can change at a later time.</P>

<H3><A NAME="preinstallsteps"></A>Pre-install steps</H3>



<H4>Decide where to install.</H4>



<P>The Installer will ask for a path to a directory which initially should not 

  exist, e.g. /usr/local/dlxstest. The installer will create 'dlxs' under /usr/local 

  and populate it. This path will be referred to as <B>DLXSROOT</B> and is accessed 

  by the middleware as an environment variable. You should set DLXSROOT in your 

  unix shell and for the Apache web server. Web server configuration info below. 

  Setting DLXS in the shell is necessary when running some DLXS command line scripts. 

</P>



<P>We recommend you install as a normal user with a <B>umask</B> of

022 which creates files permitted as 664 or 775.</P>



<H4>Extracting/Installing XPat / tif2web</H4>

<P>We are still finalizing the packaging of tif2web which will give more control 

  over the resulting images and support PNG in affition to GIF. It will replace 

  tif2gif. For the workshop we are using tif2gif. The installation of tif2web 

  will follow closely the steps for installing XPat.</P>

<P>Uncompress and untar the XPat tarfile where you would like to store the XPat 

  executables. For example, at many sites, this is /usr/local/. You would typically 

  use one of the following commands/methods, replacing all items in curly braces 

  (i.e., { }) with appropriate values:</P>

  <LI>mrsid_retrieve (required for ImageClass)

</UL>



<P>In addition you'll need standard unix utilities installed and present in $PATH: 

  make, mkdir, ln, cat, chmod.</P>



<P>XPAT and tif2web are (or will be) part of the DLXS distribution. Obtain the 

  others as follows:</P>



<UL>

  <LI>c42pdf [ <A HREF="http://c42pdf.ffii.org/" TARGET="external">http://c42pdf.ffii.org/</A>

  <LI>mrsid_retrieve [ <A HREF="http://www.lizardtech.com" TARGET="external">http://www.lizardtech.com</A> 

    ] 

</UL>



<P>Install these on your system as required for the Classes you plan to install 

  and include them in $PATH. Adding them to $PATH is not required but if you add 

  them, the installer will be able to offer you their actual locations when it 

  prompts.</P>

<H3><A NAME="reqperlmodules"></A>Required Perl modules</H3>



<P>We currently recommend you use the standard <B>Perl 5.6.1</B> release. In addition 
  you'll need to install these additional modules which can be obtained from <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</A>. 
  These modules are checked for existence as a sanity check but many are part 
  of the standard distribution. The Installer will list those not found when it 
  runs. Only those not in the standard distribution need to be fetched from CPAN. 
  <B>NOTE</B>: Socket and Net ::hostent are used directly by the Install script 
  and must be available in order to run the Install program. With these 2 exceptions 
  you may run the Installer without obtaining the additional modules so long as 
  you fetch and install them before running the DLXS middleware.</P>

&nbsp;

The next question allows you to pick between performing a first-time

installation or reconfiguring an existing installation.

&nbsp;

For a FIRST-TIME INSTALLATION you will be asked where to install DLXS.

You should supply a full path.  For example, if you choose

/do/not/use, the installer will

&nbsp;

        (1) create an install directory named /do/not/use

        (2) mark it with a timestamp

        (3) extract the tarfiles into that directory.

&nbsp;

This install directory is also inserted as a string into a number <BR>of working and configuration example files.

&nbsp;

The middleware uses the DLXSROOT environment variable to locate <BR>its pieces in the install tree.  The DLXSROOT environment variable <BR>should be set to /do/not/use for your Unix shell.

&nbsp;

For the web server, this variable and value are written to an <BR>example file called 

DLXSROOT/bin/installer/config-examples/httpd.conf.dlxs.

&nbsp;

You may use that example configuration file to configure your <BR>Apache server environment. Or you may define DLXSROOT for your 

server using your own configuration. 

&nbsp;

For a RECONFIGURATION, you will be asked for the install directory.

The directory must be one containing a completed installation <BR>of CD-ROM No. 8.

&nbsp;

Is this an I)nitial install or a R)econfiguration? (I/R) [I] 

Where would you like to install DLXS? [/do/not/use] /l1/dlxstest</B></PRE>

  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>This is where you specify DLXSROOT as explained

above. Note the option to "re-configure". If you choose it, you will

be prompted for the location of a completed installation. The

installer will then make another pass over the installed middleware

.cfg files allowing you to change values you entered during the

initial installation or subsequent reconfigurations. You can do this

repeatedly.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="postinstallsteps"></A>Post-install steps</H2>



<H3><A NAME="sessiondirs"></A>Create session directories (Required for CSV sessions)</H3>



<P>If your session database type is CSV, create the session and session lock subdirectories 

  in the locations you specified when configuring DlpsSession.cfg and change the 

  permissions on them to give write access for the UID of the web server.</P>



<H3><A NAME="permissions"></A>Change directory and file permissions</H3>



<P>The DLXSROOT/web/t/text/<B>gifcvtdir</B> is created by the Install program 

  with 777 permissions. Optionally, you may want to change permissions on this 

  directory to make it writeable only to the UID of the web server.</P>



<P>The files (sample database tables) in DLXSROOT/misc/db are installed with 666 

  permissions. Optionally, you may want to change permissions on these files to 

  make them accessible only to the UID of the web server.</P>



<H3><A NAME="apacheconfig"></A>Apache config sample files</H3>



<P>Examine DLXSROOT/bin/installer/config-examples/httpd.conf.dlxs.  

You may integrate this segment into your Apache configuration file,

adapting as necessary. It assumes you want to run your DLXS

installation on a virtual host called dlxs.&lt;?dlxs-install

var="hostname"?&gt; (where the part between the braces will be

replaced with the hostname of the machine you installed on) and that

you have created the proper DNS record, typically

dlxs.&lt;?dlxs-install var="hostname"?&gt; IN CNAME &lt;?dlxs-install

var="hostname"?&gt;</P>



<P>If you would like to run your DLXS installation on a different

virtual host, please consult your Apache documentation.</P>



<P><I>You can </I> comment-out the basic auth section in httpd.conf.dlxs basic 

  authentication for the collmgr. If you disable this be aware that the collmgr 

  requires some form of authentication which sets the REMOTE_USER variable for 

  proper operation. So, to run "out of the box", the easiest thing to do is to 

  use the "Basic Auth" sample configuration.</P>



<P>The file DLXSROOT/bin/installer/config-examples/htpasswd.dlxs codes the administrative 

  password <B>dlxsadm</B> for the collmgr with the password <B><I>collmgr. </I> 

  </B>You will probably also want to change the password to a different value 

  using the Apache program:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P> <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier, mono">% htpasswd passwordfile username</FONT></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier, mono">passwordfile</FONT> is APACHE/conf/htpasswd.dlxs 

  and <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier, mono">username</FONT> is dlxsadm. Note 

  htpasswd.dlxs will then need to be place in the "conf" subdirectory of you Apache 

  installation.</P>

<P>If you have a DLXS installation that predates CD-ROM #8 a conversion utility 

  , new in version 8, called <B><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier, mono">dbconv</FONT></B> 

  in DLXSROOT/bin/db can be used to capture the data in your existing colldb files 

  and merged into the CSV tables located in DlXSROOT/misc/db See documentation 

  on database functionality for complete instructions. </P>
