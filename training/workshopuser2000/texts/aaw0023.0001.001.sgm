AN ESSAY
ON THE
EXTENSION OF THE PUBLIC GROUNDS IN THE CITY OF
WASHINGTON, AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE SAME.
The objects to be attained are manifold and various &mdash;-some being necessary to health, others of national import; and all blending utility and
beauty harmoniously together, as a 8ystem of improvement commensurate
with the Metropolis of a great Nation.
The magnitude and magnificence of the public buildings already finished and in progress, give a foretaste of their ultimate grandeur, and of
the requisite surrounding embellishments which, depending chiefly on
trees and shrubs in variety, will require years of growth to perfect;
whereas, though edifices necessarily precede outside embellishments, still,
the building when finished has reached its zenith alike for beauty as for
use. It ever remains the same except in its progress of decay, and all
its beauty depends on sight alone, while well planted ornamental grounds
arrive at new beauties at every stage of growth to the mature state, with
powers of rejuvenescence, outlasting a long succession of edifices, yet
ever varying, ever changing, ever beautiful, glorious to behold in the varied tints of their gorgeous drapery, perfuming the air from the odors of
a thousand flowers, while the feathered songsters secure in these charming
retreats
'...for their quiet nests and plenteous food
Pay with their grateful voice."
In the first place let us consider the great national objects of utility to
be introduced into these improvements before we treat of their extent,
localities, and connections one with another. They consist of an arboretum Americanurn and national botanic and zoological gardens.  Their
utility will hardly be doubted at this enlightened period of the world, yet
it may be useful to point out their leading features and characteristics, so
that their true extent and importance in a country so vast in territory
and fertile in production shall be correctly appreciated. And, first,
of the
ARBORETUM.
It should be composed exclusively of the trees and shrubs of the American Continent. The sylva of this vast continent embraces tribes and
families so numerous, of climates and soils so various, that the selection
of ground for such a collection should present the greatest possible variety of surface and aspect, with a palm house and other conservatories
superadded. These families, on surfaces suited to them, will admit of much
perspective display by artistic grouping, &amp;c., &amp;c., and all should be classified and labeled, so that the botanic and common names, with their

Classes, orders, &amp;c., may be read at a glance of the eye. The labels may
consist of cast iron stakes placed by the object named upon them, so as
to facilitate a peripatetic student.
THE BOTANIC GARDEN
I would call national, because the collection should be made from all
parts of the world, comprising specimens in every class, order, genus,
and species treated of in botany, not included in the arboretum, which, as
will appear in the sequel, I would have joined together, as possessing
many requisites in common, and designed for instruction in the same
sciences.
The first object of a botanic garden is to exhibit collections of plants
for the improvement of botanical science; secondly, to display living specimens useful in agriculture, horticulture, and the arts; and thirdly, the
acclimatizing of exotics for dissemination over the country.
Some of the most important superstructures of a botanic garden consist of a curator's house, containing an office, a library, lecture room,
seed room, and herbarium, or hortus siccus. Near to this house should
be a range of green and hot houses, with accommodations for attendants
and fuel; and to these, again, a range of forcing pits and frames, with a
compost yard convenient. There should be, also, many other fixtures
and compartments, such as an aquarium, with bog, pond, spring and salt
water cistern, for marine algs, a rock work, with pendent walls, tunnels,
vaults, and caves, open in different degrees and directions, for other of
the cryptogamie;  a gramineum for the grasses, and other compartments
for medical and poisonous plants and for florists' flowers; others, again,
for shrubs and plants belonging to agriculture, horticulture, dyeing, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., &amp;c., with sub-compartments for creepers, climbers, succulents, bulbs,
&amp;c., &amp;c., all to be scientifically arranged for the convenience of study.
THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
These gardens will require deep pure water for a piscatorium below,
and an aquatic aviary upon its surface; shallow water with muddy bottom, where the hippopotamus, crocodile, and alligator might wallow, the
tortoise and newt find hiding places, and the beaver, otter, mink, and
muskrat be supplied with appropriate burrows. A park will be required
for the herbavora, and structures such as paddocks, dens, caves, cages, and
other fastnesses, necessary for confining the carnivora, poisonous serpents,
reptiles, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., with buildings for elephants, camels, monkeys, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., and accommodations for the necessary attendants.
As the leading nation of the American continent, it becomes our duty
to preserve its nomads. And where can be found a placeso befitting as
the National Metropolis? Nor can we, in justice to mankind, or with
credit to ourselves, delay the performance of the obligation, for even now
many of its animals have become extinct, and only known to tradition,
while others are rapidly disappearing.
But botany is suffering still more from neglect; for the most interesting of our vegetable offspring are in the hands of foster parents who have
given them foreign names, and taught their "young ideas how to shoot"
in a foreign soil, and to know their own native land no more forever!</P><P><PB
ID="p00050005" N="5"> 
And here permit me to state a fact in proof, that from the city of London you may in one day see a greater variety of the trees, shrubs, and
smaller plants of America than you would meet with in travelling over
the continent itself from the arctic to the antarctic circle! This disparity in the collections of the two countries, however great it may appear,
can be overcome by us much easier than England made the acquisitions,
by equal perseverance in research and skill in cultivation; for doubtless
we have "plenty of the same sort left," and nearer at hand, if we would
but hunt them up. But in one point of view we are injured past remedy.
It is the law of science, as of nations, that a thing discovered belongs to
the discoverer, and ownership implies a right to name, while the same law
forbids its being ever changed when once catalogued with a classical termination. Hence, in the ambition of discoverers to perpetuate their own
names, or the names of the high dignitaries of their country, we find
many of the rarest, most beautiful and valuable of American plants bearirg upon their exotic life English names tatinized, to wit: Victoria Regia, Albertine, Wellingtonia, Douglassii, Smithiana, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
The English, doubtless, surpass all other people at the present time in
botanical knowledge, with a Lindley, a Hooker, and a Paxton at their
head. Yet the Hortus Britannicus is of itself exceedingly limited and
meager. Whence, then, comes this pre-eminence? Is it inherent in the
Anglo-Saxon blood? No more, I trow, than in their horses, kine, and
sheep. The true origin of their superiority in this respect may be traced
rather to their primitive wants and circumscribed dominion. This condition drove them early out upon the seas, and like the Argonaute they
sought the golden fleece in every clime, achieving every excellence, physical and mental, consequent upon an intercourse so universal.
" Methodumn intelligo nature convenientem quw alienas species conjungit, nee cognatas separat."
A thorough knowledge of the vegetable kingdom, from the simplest
formation of the protophita to the gigantic sequoia, should be inculcated
by the institutions of the country generally, whose wide domain is so
richly endowed with the most perfect living specimens. And they should
be collected together and so arranged that "he who runs may read," and
understand what he does read. This is effected by the formation of arboretums and botanic gardens. They form a laboratory where the natural elements and the arts combine to work out some of the most abstruse
problems incident to the multifarious pursuits of man. Here, the science
of botany asserts her prerogatives over agriculture, horticulture, arboriculture, floriculture, and many of the fine arts, while she becomes also
the handmaid to all.  The philosopher, the historian, the geographer,
and the naturalist, come here as the peripatetics of old visited the sacred
groves, to peruse the open book of nature, the medical student to take
counsel of Hygeia, the architect to study the ornate, the painter the beautiful, and the poet to realize the creations of imagination. Here the
pious feel nearer to Deity, and the vicious awed by the consciousness of
His more immediate presence.
The importance of such establishments is nowhere better understood
than in Great Britain; as proof of which, I need only state the fact that
since the year 1800, over sixty arboretums have been established in that</P><P><PB

island alone, and nearly all connected with botanic gardens; some created by the government for public instruction, some by the nobility and
gentry for more exclusive amusement, and many for commercial purposes.
And all this is exclusive of parks, lawns, promenades, and pleasure gardens, designed for recreation only, and scattered most profusely over the
kingdom.
A love of trees and shrubs increases with the age and population of a
country; not, however, until the woodman's axe has hewn down the
primeval forests of the United States do we begin to appreciate their
grandeur, beauty, and worth. Trees are the grandest objects of vegetable production, and decidedly the most useful; but, taking longer to mature, and more room than smaller plants, they are in less demand, and
consequently there is less incentive to their cultivation. Still, trees must
ever rank next to architectural display as ornaments to a country, and
particularly in populous cities, where buildings so much preponderate,
and it is there we see them most admired and cherished, particularly in
the capitals of nations throughout the world. For all nations, ancient
and modern, irrespective of the forms of government, have ever been,
still are, and ever will be, proud of their capitals, they being the centre
of the political power of the nation, and of intercommunication with other
nations. Whatever is deemed worthy of imitation in one, will be sure to
appear sooner or later in the others, " revised, corrected, and improved"
in accordance with the national taste.
And this is most apparent among the capital cities of Europe. In a
display of the fine arts we may instance the Vatican. While the church
exalted Rome over other capitals, all christendom struggled for supremacy in sculpture, painting, and poetry, with a view to her embellishment.
This struggle elicited the greater energies in Italy, where the church was
most potent, which struck out those wonderful corruscations of genius
impersonated by a Ghiberti, a Michael Angelo, a Raphael, a Rossi, and
a Correggio, in sculpture and painting, and by a Dante, a Petrarch, a
Boccaccio, and a Tasso in poetry. But the prestige of Italy was overthrown by the Reformation. Since that great event, notwithstanding
her advantages of climate, locality, and undisturbed government in the
Papal States, competition has sprung up wherever the people eschewed
the dogmas of the Church of Rome and resolved upon establishing a literature of their own. Consequently, other old capitals have been embellished and many new ones built up and adorned, while the " Eternal City"
pales in the effulgence that unfettered genius has shed around them.
Even little frost-bitten Sweden was destined through her Linnaeus to open
the book of Flora to Italy herself-the land of sunshine tnd flowers; and
Stockholm now vies with many capitals of more favored climes in a dis play of the picturesque and beautiful. Since the advent of this remark able man, botany has brought poetry, painting, and sculpture to its aid
in ornamenting and embellishing parks, lawns, and pleasure grounds of
every description in and around populous cities, making them the lungs,
the great breathing zones, and out-door concert rooms, where the happy
populace resort singly or in masses for exercise and recreation, while the
circumambient air is rendered the purer by sustaining animal and vege table life in equilibrio as it were-the one consuming oxygen and genera ting carbonic acid, while the other is reversing the process.</P><P><PB

The cities of Paris and London have perhaps made most progress in
improvements of this description. Paris has her immense Bois de Boulogne; her Boulevards; her Jardin des Plantes, du Luxumburg, and des
Tuilleries; her seventy odd places, (called squares in English,) tastefully
ornamented with trees, shrubs, flowers, fountains and statuary, among the
most conspicuous of which may be mentioned the place Vend6me, with its
column of brass twelve feet in diameter, and one hundred and fifty feet
high; the place du Carousel, des Victoires, de la Concorde, du Chatelet,
le Champe de Mars, large enough for the review of 150,000 men; les
Champs Elysees, &amp;c. The Seine divides the city into two unequal parts,
connected by many magnificent bridges. It furnishes an ample outlet to
the drainage of the city, and aids greatly the ventilation-it being on an
average some 350 feet wide.  The zoological department is arranged in
the Jardin des Plantes, where even the monkeys enjoy a magnificent
crystal palace, enclosing trees and shrubbery congenial to them.
But the city of London I take for our archetype-it being undoubtedly
the best drained, the best ventilated, most tastefully ornamented, and
healthiest city, compared with population, in the world. She is bisected
by the Thames, which averages 400 yards wide and 12 feet in depth,
receiving all the drainage. There are New river, and the Serpentine,
which supply the lakes, reservoirs, and fountains with water. She has
five large parks in her midst, named Hyde, Regent's, St. James', Green,
and Victoria, containing some 2,000 acres, richly planted, and tastefully
laid out for carriage, equestrian, and pedestrian exercise. Then the
Royal Kensington gardens of 400 acres, still more highly ornamented,
they being for pedestrians exclusively. She has besides over eighty
squares of eight to ten acres each, ornamented with trees, shrubs, fountains, &amp;c., &amp;c. Those of most notoriety are Lincoln's Inn Fields, Russell,
Bloomsbury, Belgrave, Berkley,  Cavendish, Grosvenor,  Hanover,  St.
James, Manchester, Portman, and Trafalgar. Buat Birnam wood will
come to Dunsinane: "The cry is still, they come!"  At Hampton Court
there are 600 acres of park, and 50 acres of pleasure gardens;  at "Richmond great park" 2,250 acres more-all now upon the confines of the
city, and daily open to the whole population. Then again within seven
miles of London, at Kew, is the great national botanic garden of 200
acres more, which is pronounced to be the most perfect of its kind in the
world.   The Zoological establishment is in the Regent's park; where is,
also, a well-arranged botanic garden, supported entirely by private
subscription.
With these facts before us, let us compare the condition of our own
metropolis with that of our progenitors-" not that we love Cwsar less,
but our country more," that we may see more clearly our own nakedness,
and feel more effectively our own necessities, through the strongest principle of ratiocination-contrast. Besides, it is very extensively believed
that brother Jonathan dislikes to be outdone in anything by his neighbor
Mr. Bull. Geographical position, as to climate, scenery, and surrounding
materials, is in our favor; but we lack a Thames and its tributaries for
drainage and ventilation. We have, however, what seems to content us
in their stead-.a Goose creek, and an uncouth stinking ditch, flanked by
morass and frog-pond, as tributaries, for drainage. As to ventilation we</P><P><PB

suffer from excess, in the too free circulation of malaria.  But enough!
such comparisons are odorous, as Mrs. Malaprop would express it-too
much so to dwell upon.
Is it not time, then, at least to commence such improvements? Shall
the garish marble be forever reflected in the cesspool, echoing back the
serenade of frogs? Or will the fear of an adverse public opinion cause
you to hesitate? If so, let me exhort you to assume the responsibilities
that belong to your eminent station: Be statesmen. Direct your energies
to advance, instead of retarding the national destiny. Be the champions
of a true progress-not of that spurious party juggling                 " That palters with us in a double sense;
That keeps the word of promise to our ear,
And breaks it to our hope."
In short, lead public opinion, instead of being led too much by it. Your
individual intelligence gave you popularity at home; the country will
confide in your united efforts to serve the general weal. And should not
the present deplorable condition of public morals arouse your combined
energies? The hand of sordid opulence has been sowving the land broadcast for years, with the most seductive vices, of which even this community
have been reaping a too abundant harvest, of midnight orgies, and crimes
of deepest dye! The outstretched arm of the law is powerless to stay the
assassin's steel; while each day's events but extend the dark record!  If
virtue cannot be enforced upon a free people, then try persuasion. Create
new schools of learning more attractive than your dingy scholastic walls,
redolent of the fumes of tobacco, and only ornamented with festoons by
that most ancient of architects, the araneus. Throw around the alma
mater drapery more befitting her charms, and you will allure wealth to
nobler aspirations; to a higher order of intellectual antagonisms; of
literary refinements.   The  Genius of Liberty will not be enchained.
Surround her, then, with the beautiful, as well as useful, and she will ever
pursue the paths of virtue, honor, and truth. If these postulates be correctly assumed, the deduction follows, that a new era in our government
must be inaugurated, or it is destined ere long to sink in despotism!
Moral or physical force has ever ruled, and ever will rule mankind.
Deeply impressed with the importance of declaring these trite but solemn
truths, I cast them now, as my mite, into the great national caldron of
PUBLIC OPINIoN.
OF THE PUBLIC GROUNDS.
In the next place I will proceed to consider the extent, localities, and
connections of the grounds, necessary to accomplish all the objects desired, including drainage. To attain these objects I propose four grand
divisions: The central surrounds the Capitol, and the other three connect therewith; so that from its porticos and corridors the whole and
every part of the four sections will be in view, and never liable to obstruction from intervening objects. The second section joins on the
north; the third, on the west; and the fourth, on the south.
SECTION ONE,
Has the Capitol of the United States for a stand-point, commanding
the finest prospects and most extensive views of the whole city. I pro</P><P><PB
ID="p00090009" N="9">

pose for its boundaries 2d street west; C street north, MAassachusetts
avenue and B street north; 13th street east; B street south, North
Carolina avenue and C street south; containing about 310 acres. All
streets and avenues bounding the public grounds to be calculated 150
feet wide. The descent on the west front of the Capitol I would have
divided into three or more terraces of equal height and grade. The
upper terrace to be elliptical, and in conformity with the Capitol extensions.  The other terraces to vary in their curves proportionably to their
relative distances from the upper terrace and outer boundary - gradually diminishing their height and distance apart, in approach to the highest
grade, and said boundary; keeping up the lateral grades full throughout
the centre. This section will require but little more grading to develop
its beauties; for, as a general principle, an adherence to nature will
achieve the picturesque and beautiful in the highest degree. The natural
form and position of the surface should dictate boundaries, so far as other
surrounding circumstances will permit; and never be subject to arbitrary
geometrical lines beyond what necessity imposes, and always apparent.
And in carrying out the details of a system so complicated, I have endeavored to keep the utsle ever present before me; and in fixing boundaries I have varied as little as possible from the plan of the city, and
never doing so without estimating a full compensation in the general improvement of the health of the city, and in creating sites for charming
private residences.  Of all geometrical lines, the straight line is most
homogeneous with landscape and perspective, as the visual ray cannot
be bent; all curvatures in perspective should exhibit a reason - the
more abrupt, the more manifest.
SECTION TWO,
Is bounded on the south by C street north; on the west by New
Jersey avenue and 3d street west, to the intersection of P street north;
on the north-west by a new street from 3d and P to North Boundary
street, at the intersection of North Capitol street; on the  north  by
Boundary Street to the east side of 3d street east; on the east by a
straight line thence to C street north, at the intersection of the east side
of 2d street east- containing about 380 acres.  I propose to divide this
section between an Arboretum, a Botanic garden, and sufficient ground set
apart for a new Presidential mansion. Here, a little to the west of north,
and about a mile from the Capitol, is a ridge, overlooking all objects ever
likely to be interposed between them, and offering the best site for such
a mansion within the limits of the city.  It is near the intersection of
two fine avenues -  New York and New Jersey; the first  leading to the
present mansion of the President, and the last to the Capitol. It commands a view, in front, down the Potomac to Fort Washington; and, in
the rear, of an interestilng and picturesque part of the adjacent country.
The present mansion might be used by the Department of the Interior,
and the edifices occupied by the War and Navy Departments, appropriated to its Land and Pension Bureaus. Then, near the north-east and
south-east angles of section one, at 5th street east, I would erect suitable
edifices for these departments, and attach the grounds of their present
enclosure, and of the President's house, Treasury and State Department.,</P><P><PB
ID="p00100010" N="10"> 
10
to section three. But as I would not wander out of the proper sphere,
with a bow apologetic to your able architect, and magic Meigs, " revenons a nos noutons."
All of section two north of, say L street, I propose to divide between
a new Presidential mansion and a botanic garden. The connection will
contribute to the perfection of both, combining economy with convenience.
This locality possesses all the natural capabilities of a botanic garden, to
wit: space, for its necessary extent; situation, in reference to surrounding objects; variety, as to surface, soil, and aspect; water, from internal
living springs; and approach, from the south. The ridge, which, near its
western termination, furnishes the building site, juts out to the east a
bold promontory, yet not so far as to isolate any portion of the valley injuriously, but adding variety of aspect and local temperature. This
ridge should be sloped off to a flat grade on the south side, and its east,
northeast, and north declivities, terraced for the culture of exotics that
cannot withstand the full glare of our summer sun and dry atmosphere.
The little valley, immediately north of the ridge, is sheltered from the
north-west, north, and north-east winds; a desideratum that can only be
appreciated fully by those who have gained knowledge from long practical experience. Here there is to be obtained from the hand of nature
nearly every pre-requisite of a botanic garden.
The remainder of section two I propose for the arboretum; and the
grounds here allotted are better adapted to the purpose than any other,
to the same extent, in the whole city. But, unfortunately, the railroad
passes through it, which, if not to be banished from the city altogether,
should be removed from its present position. I therefore recommend
bringing it into the city (if it must come,) a little to the east of its present entrance, and keeping along to the east and south of the present
track, to the east boundary of section two, between E and F streets.
From this point an easy ascent exists, through a gorge, up the hill to 0
street. This arrangement would place the depot only two-and-a-half
squares further to the east than its present position.  To retain it as it
is will greatly injure the arboretum in a very important part of it, as the
road will require to be fenced off to itself; and H street, which must be
kept open, would have to be taken out of its direct course through the
grounds to pass it over the railroad, on a bridge, at the deep cut. All
the streets and avenues that are to be kept open through the public
grounds, should, also, be fenced off with opposite gates, both for carriages and equestrians, placed near enough for one lodge and one keeper
to serve for each crossing.
SECTION THREE
Is bounded on the south by Maryland avenue and B street south; on the
west by the Potomac river; on the north by F street north to 17th west,
and by said street to Pennsylvania avenue; thence to 15th street; by
said street to B street north; thence by said street and Missouri avenue
to 2d street west, and thence to the beginning. The whole area, following the river boundary as it now is, and deducting the ground occupied
by buildings, and the streets to remain open, is about 388 acres. That
portion of this section called the Mall to be divided by three streets into</P><P><PB
ID="p00110011" N="11"> 
11
four unequal parts; the first, extending only from 2d to 421 street west,
is unoccupied, irregular in form, and insignificant, except as the connect ing link to section one; the second part, lying between 421 and 7th streets,
contains the Armory; the third from 7th to 12th, the Smithsonian Institute; and the fourth part, from 12th street to the river, contains the
Washington Monument. All other streets passing through the Mall to
be discontinued.
But I beg leave to propose still another very considerable addition to
this section, to be reclaimed from the river, by carrying out an improvement to the navigation of the Potomac, of the first importance to the City
of Washing,ton, as reported by A. L. Rives, Esq., civil engineer, to the
Department of the Interior, in the autumn of 1856, to which I refer.
This improvement consists in establishing a uniform curve to the river front,
concave to the channel, from say 23d street west down to the Arsenal
point; throwing all the water into the curve, by extending a breakwater
wall from the foot of Mason's island across the Virginia channel, with a
curve and length sufficient to force the whole volume of water into the
opposite curve forming the shore-line of the city; whence it would continue throughout the whole length of the curve to the Arsenal point. For
it is a law in hydrology that currents must follow curves, impinging upon
the outer verge or shore-line with intensity proportionate to the length of
the cord of the arc, not to exceed 120~, or the third part of a circle. This
law is verified by all alluvial water-courses; and Mr. Rives, in allusion
to this principle, (p. 4,) says: "It is well known that currents, in curves,
form stable deep channels. And again, on the same page, speaking of
the action of a current, he says, "It followed its curved outline with willing mathematical precision." This precision can only be disturbed by
abrasions, and only so far as they change the outline or verge of the shore.
Hiere then these divided waters, which prove insufficient for the navigation of two channels, are all thrown into one upon the confines of the city,
throughout the whole river front, with an addition of territory, computed
by the engineer to contain 166 acres, which will round off the shore-line
to correspond with the rest of the curve below it. Permit me further to
observe in this place, that the whole of this tract, and much more adjoining it, is nearly filled up to low-water mark, with almost daily accretions,
which tends continually to diminish the water upon the shore of the city;
but its permanent emergence, so far as may be desired, above that level,
must depend upon the extraneous means pointed out. And it is my opinion that this concentration of the water would create a sufficient force
of current to sweep out a channel to the extent of its volume, without the
aid of dredging, as the engineer has suggested.

SECTION FOUR
Is bounded on the east by 1st street east and New Jersey avenue; on the
south by the Eastern Branch; on the west by the Arsenal water-wall
along James creek; thence in a straight line to the southeast corner of
2d street west and Virginia avenue; thence by the west side of 2d street
to section one, and thence to the beginning.  The area contains about 420

Eastern Branch affords deep, clear water for a Piscatorium, and James
creek furnishes the other water required. This and section three should
be planted in park style, in conformity with local objects and perspective
views.  The acclivities which lead up into section one, I would appropriate to the tender conifers, magnolias, rhododendrons, &amp;c.; displaying
the choicest specimens over section one, so far as they can be protected
by the hardier northern pines, spruces, and firs, which should occupy the
whole range of irregular declivity bordering upon section one to the north,
and sloping down more or less abruptly into section two. This arangement places the rarest of the half.-hardy trees and shrubs upon the beautiful plateau which lies to the east of the Capitol and immediately north
and south of it, and could not fail to enhance the beauty and interest of
all its surroundings. It is not the purpose, however, of this essay to enter
into the details of ornamental planting, where so many styles would have
to be consulted in the attainment of such a vast variety of objects. Besides, did the occasion otherwise permit, without the designated grounds,
such a labor would be supererogatory.
OF A NEW PRESIDENTIAL MANSION.
Of the site, I have said enough already, as in my opinion it will bespeak
its own praise to every intelligent beholder. But the present Mansion,
aside from its unhealthy position as a residence during the latter part of
summer and the early autumn, and which must ever continue while the
Potomac remains subject to tides and alluvial deposits, it has become too
small for the objects of its creation. It must therefore be greatly enlarged,
or another constructed. But I am opposed to its situation also. From
the position of Departments and places of public business, it stands in
the midst of a great thoroughfare, where, during the hours of business, a
constant stream of anxious humanity is ever hurrying to and fro, with
package  in hand-not of encomiastics, announcing  pre-eminence of
"integrity and ability," designed to travel no further; but that pass on,
through the same portico, to quite a different class of pigeon-holes! The
President should be removed from such a melange.  He can no longer, if
he would, perform the business details of his high office; and you have
provided for him subordinates sufficient for all such purposes. Why then
should he not be relieved from its petty annoyances, especially those not
intended for him?  I cannot look upon this abuse of the "White House"
but as a great desecration. The President of the United States, whom
we select from our midst to occupy for a season the most exalted station
among men, is entitled to the respect due his high position; and we, as
his fellow-citizens, fail in a proper regard for ourselves by every derogation from it.
The house might be fitted up for, say, the Department of the Interior,
without undergoing any external alteration, which should never be made
to the injury of its present symmetry and beauty. I am most decidedly
opposed to all patching, particularly architectural; and, besides, are we
not forbidden "to put new cloth upon an old garment?"  If a building
possesses architectural beauty, it is more or less as a whole; and it would
be difficult, if not impossible, to alter its proportions, or to enlarge or
diminish it, and retain the purity, the oneness, which belonged to the origi</P><P><PB
ID="p00130013" N="13">

nal. And in my judgment this criticism may be applied to the Capitol
extensions, upon which, permit me to remark, en passant, that the great
extent of the wings renders the central part too small and low for them;
and the immensity of the cupola, instead of giving relief, will add to its
squat appearance. The centre building should be enlarged on the east
side, proportionate to the size and position of the wings, and raised at least
thirty feet higher. Then the cupola, crowning the centre, would give to
the whole a much more symmetrical appearance, and somewhat typical of
the "Bird of Jove," poised upon his perch, with expanding pinion, about
to swoop upon the foe! But as it is to be, I fear the resemblance will be
much stronger of a great Muscovy duck, threatening battle with his
smaller companions of the poultry yard.
A country seat for the President, I understand, has been suggested. But
I cannot imagine any satisfactory reason for such an establishment, though
somewhat skilled in castle-building; and in my opinion such a castle hadc
better be "in the air" outright than out of Washington, and about as
likely to be occupied by that dignitary. The idea to me is preposterous.
A Presidential Mansion in the city is necessary for the accommodation
of officials and citizens having business with the President. But in the
recess of the Congress, while the dog-star reigns, and absenteeism is the
order of the day at the Seat of Government, the President may feel as
disinclined to solitude as other people; or possibly he may have a home
of his own-a Wheatland or villa somewhere in the confines of the nationthat he might wish to visit occasionally, to look after his own private
affairs. What is the use, then, of a country house here? A I'residential
Mansion should be in all respects commensurate with the office and nation;
and such an edifice placed where I have pointed out will be alike convenient to Congress and the Cabinet, and at the same time free from the
noise and dust of the great public thoroughfares; while its grounds, being
united with a great Botanic Garden and Arboretum, will increase their
effect, and add greatly to the interest of the whole.
The United States Observatory is also in a very unhealthy locality,
owing to its contiguity to the river and the necessity for night labor. The
space between it and the river bank (which is here quite abrupt) is insufficient to admit a belt of foliage broad enough to absorb the miasma that
condenses in the night-time of warm seasons, and floats upon it. Besides,
the greatest protection being needed on the south, or river side, where
the lowest range of horizon is required, renders the interposition of trees
inadmissible.  These objections to its present situation being difficult if
not impossible to overcome, I propose to have it removed to a more eligible site, say Meridian Hill, which is among the highest eminewces overlooking the city; has a good astronomical horizon; and will be rendered
perfectly healthy by my system of drainage, as no unhealthy exhalations
can afterwards transpire in its vicinity. The present superstructure is
also already become too small for its purposes. Its grounds would be
included within the Park I propose to plant between F street and the river,
which would have sufficient breadth to secure the inhabitants along that
street from the miasmata of the river &mdash;making it a most desirable street
for residences, on account of its being on a ridge sloping gently to the
north and south.</P><P><PB ID="p00140014" N="14"> 
14
In the next place, I propose to have the Jail removed somewhere upon
the confines of the city, for the double purpose of taking it from the centre
of population and of converting the vacant ground north of the Infirmary
into a Market, and do away with the Centre or Mfarsh Market altogether.
These measures would abate two nuisances-the one annoying a respectable neighborhood with disgraceful sights and sounds, and the other marring the beauty of the most populous avenue, and adding filth daily to the
pestiferous canal, The space proposed is now traversed by a large sewer
from the northwest to the southeast corner, and thence falls into the Tiber,
near the intersection of C street north and 2d street west, leaving ample
capacity and fall for thorough drainage. This place descends inward,
diagonally, with the drainage of the sewer, which gives it a peculiar fitness
for market purposes; and is quite central-being between 4th and 5th
streets west, and E and G streets north. Few inhabitants would be incommoded more than others would be benefitted by the change, even at
the present time, and they are Islanders of the Seventh Ward, who should
have a market of their own, south of the Mall.
Near the eastern termination of section one, at the intersection of East
Capitol street with 12th street east, I propose to place Mills's forthcoming equestrian statue of George Washington. Its position there will
be central, also, on Massachusetts, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee avenues, and on elevated commanding ground. The vistas from
this statue along all these streets and avenues should never be obstructed,
making this magnificent monument crown the east, as the other to Washington will the west, like the fame of the Father of his Country, never
to be obscured from the gaze of an admiring world.
I entertain no doubt that all the ground I have delineated will ultimately
be required for the public necessities. It amounts to much less than is allotted to any other great metropolis in christendom. I would not, therefore,
bate an inch of it even after the 166 acres is reclaimed from the water, as
we then shall not exceed in the grand total, seventeen hundred acres.
And now, gentlemen of Congress, having reached my utmost expansion,
I shall leave it with you to decide if the frog's fate in the fable is to be
typical of mine. But before you proceed to the consideration of a subject of such grave importance, ", I rise to a privileged question," for the
purpose of making a personal explanation. And I am the freer to take
advantage of your "parliamentary rules," because I neither ask, expect
to receive, or have received, anything for all this labor but my pains.
They, however, have visited me like a tertian for years with periodical
paroxysms until the magnificence of your edifices has brought on an exacerbation that has terminated in an uncontrollable cacothes scribendi.
Yes, Mr. Speaker! residing near the city of Washington for more than
twenty years, (but without ever owning property in it,) I have been
watching the progress of events that should some day crown Washington
with a metropolitan grandeur equal to the greatest country, if not the
greatest people on earth. But in the more lucid intermissions of the
fever I have said to myself, the time is not yet, the plan of the city is too
vast for the wealth and number of its inhabitants; the government is
poor, in debt, or engaged in war, and the vastness of the plans that ever
obtruded themselves would enchain me to silence. And even now the attempt to describe them awakens fears as abject almost as those which</P><P><PB
ID="p00150015" N="15"> 
caused the renowned Galileo to forswear himself. But I think I see the
time approaching when a nation's dignity and a people's taste shall move
hand in hand to produce a federal metropolis worthy the name of the
Pater Patrie.  Yet if I, too, prove " ahead of the times," then must I
also exclaim " E pur si muove!" " for such is the Law and the Prophets."
I cannot believe that our love of country can remain satisfied much
longer with such a comparative mediocrity, more especially while the door
stands so invitingly open as it does here for these great improvements,
giving us the opportunity at once to lead in these as in other achievements, instead of following in the wake of other nations. Energies equal
to any undertaking are spontaneous in the American people, productive
of a pride properly directed that cannot fail to lead to noble enterprises,
and therefore they should be cherished and sustained by the legislator
and philanthropist.
Drainage is a prerequisite to the health of a city, and preliminary to
grading, building, and planting. As this kind of work is generally carried on no faster than the public necessities require, any fixed principle
or plan of construction is too easily lost sight of, and their perfection marred
through mistaken economy, ignorance, or sinister design.  It is, therefore,
of the first importance that a complete system of grade and drainage for the
city of Washington should be established by law, to be carried out as a permanent measure without deviation, as the other improvements, founded
and dependent upon them, might require, and always in advance of them.
The greatest difficulty to be encountered in the drainage of the city,
will be found between 23d and 2d streets west; and between, say A
street south, at 2d street west, and the mouth of James creek, which is
the natural outlet of all the drainage that now flows into the canal.
The fall from 23d to 2d street is only about one foot, and thence to
the mouth of James creek is scant three feet, the'distances being each
about one mile and three-quarters. But above the average of the tides,
there is not over sixteen inches fall throughout the whole extent. I propose, then, to start from a point on the bank of the river where the surface is five feet above high tide mark, with a true grade thence to the
surface at 2d street west; following down the south side of B street north
to Missouri avenue, and thence in a line therewith to 2d street.  Then
fill uip with earth from adjacent acclivities the 166 acres obtained from
the river; the President's park, so called, and all contiguous ground to
the aforesaid grade, effacing the canal altogether. Then I would construct a sewer as the main drain from 23d street, along said line of grade
throughout, to 2d street; to be six feet wide to 10th street, gr.dually
widening to twelve feet on reaching 6th street, and then continue of that
width, and to be seven feet deep throughout. To have a flat bottom
flagged with stone, and covered with stone slabs, except at the crossing
of streets and carriage ways, requiring arches to be laid even with the
surface on substantial side walls of stone. This form gives greater capacity nearer the surface than the arch, and admits of being opened at any
point needful. I would establish running water through it by bringing
it from Rock Creek through an iron pipe three feet in diameter, into the
head of the sewer, with a gate at their junction, whereby this supply may
be shut off in times of flood. This water will be required to keep the

sewer free on account of its fiat bottom and low grade, and in my judgment will leave capacity sufficient for the drainage into it.
The present canal, with its zigzag ambidextrous angles, passing through
a dead level in the very heart of the city, and without expressing any satisfactory motive for doing so, is a receptacle for dead dogs, cats, rats, and such
ilk infusoria, and unquestionably the greatest nuisance in the city, and should
be expunged-the sooner the better.  I propose a canal in its stead from the
mouth of James creek to Virginia avenue, along the west boundary of the zoological park, with a basin at its headsuited to its commerce, and with the
drainage frem the west, united with that from the Tiber range, flowing into it.
The water course called Tiber creek drains the greater part of the city
north of the capitol extending from 14th street west to 9th street east,
and some six square miles of territory north of the city.  This extensive
water shed from numerous precipitous hills, occasions overflow once or
twice a year, and sometimes oftener, through the low level I have just
been treating of, when more or less damage to health and property ensue.
This greatest natural difficulty I propose not only to overcome, but convert into blessings by turning jagged banks, naked gravel pits, and shapeless pools, into purling streams, joyous cascades, instructive ponds, and
charming lakes. All this and much more may be accomplished by diverting this little stream into the various uses of a botanic garden and
arboretum, with some additional aid from  the water-works.  Ponds, cascades, and rivulets are essential to botanic gardens.  Some facilitate and
others retard the progress of water, and all with calculated quantities by
the use of dams, dykes, levies, culverts, &amp;c., &amp;c., with waste channels to
accelerate all superabundance, whereby durations also are calculated.
The water is thus conducted into the arboretum, to be converted into a
lake, the south boundary of which should be probably a little north of I
street north.  Here I would construct a dyke across the valley broad
enough to admit of carriage and equestrian ways, and walks for pedestrians to pass over it, with intermediate trees and shrubs, and with a culvert through it that could not pass water enough with the accumulations
below it to produce overflow. The culvert to be so arranged as to retain
say four feet of water in the lake, or drain it if desired; and then, say
at two-thirds of the height of this culvert, I would start a drain from the
lake on the east side immediately above the dyke, of sufficient capacity
to contain all the surplus water. This drain should be taken to G street
north, along that street to the eastern boundary of the city, and thence
to the Eastern branch, receiving the intermediate sewerage into it. The
drainage of the remaining part of the city east sheds off into the Eastern
branch without presenting any difficulty worthy of notice.
From 14th street west, at U street north, I propose to run a main
sewer in a straight line to 3d street west, at or near P street north, where
it enters the botanic garden. Again, from 14th, at U, I propose to run
another main trunk in a south westerly direction to Rock creek.  These last
three main trunks should be built circular, with a diameter not less than six
feet, with traps at the crossings of streets for inspecting and cleansing them.
The sewerage of a city should underlie water and gas mains, and conform with grades throughout. The main receiving trunks or conduits
should be still lower, and pass through the lowest lines irrespective of
streets and below foundation walls; consequently, they should be con</P><P><PB
ID="p00170017" N="17"> 
structed in advance of buildings. The only exception to this plan of construction in Washington city will be in conveying the water from the
lower part of section two. It must flow into the arch under New Jersey
avenue. This arch, then, should be continuous by way of the arch across
Pennsylvania avenue, and thence along the center of 2d street to the basin
of the new canal, to terminate with tide gates for the purpose of shutting out
the counter currents from the lower portions of both conduits, the accumulation of water in them from above always finding vent by opening the gates
with its superior pressure, before damage could ensue from overflow.
The great difficulty in the way of a complete system of drainage for
Washington consists in disposing of the superabundance of water that at
times rushes into the valley of Tiber creek. It becomes necessary, then,
to ascertain the quantity of water at its maximum and time of duration,
before the dimension of conduits for detention or acceleration can be calculated with certainty. The data for such calculations, however scientific
and abstruse, are attainable. A triangulation and topographical survey
of the whole District of Columbia, with maps and profile drawings of
every street and avenue of the city of Washington, were completed last
March, and I have been permitted to use some of the data for my own
calculations. It is a private enterprise, but I have authority from your
Coast Survey Office to say that the accuracy of the work may be relied
on. By the aid of this work every foot of surface within the city.and
without, that drains through it; every summit, descent, and distance can
be calculated to a fraction; and after a sufficient series of observations
with a rain-gauge, the exact measure of aqueducts may be arrived at for
all the various purposes required.
HOW THE FOREGOING OBJECTS ARE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.
It will become necessary to look into the history of the city of Washington more in detail, before we can arrive at a,thorough knowledge of
the present powers of Congress, and to what extent these powers should
be exerted in accomplishing such a system of improvements.
In the year 1791 the United States purchased the site of the city of
Washington from the owners of the soil. The original agreement provides
that they should surrender their title in fee to the whole area of the city,
amounting to 7,134 acres of land-the government to return to them one
moiety of the building lots, amounting only to 1,508 acres; that the
United States were to pay nothing for reservations and property in the
streets and avenues, amounting to 4,118 acres; and it is said that they
actually paid the proprietors for only 541 acres and a fraction, at the rate
of $6623 per acre, amounting to a trifle over $36,000. But even this
inconsiderable sum was not taken, it seems, from the people'S money, for
Virginia advanced the government $120,000, and Maryland $72,000 as,
probably, an inducement to establish the seat of government here; for
the constitution of the United States itself declares that "the Congress
shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,
over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of
particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of
the Government of the United States." A district by cession of particular States, point not only to the place selected, but to the Pater Patrie
who presided over the convention, as the originator as well as founder of

the "Federal City;" while the sagacious men who composed that con vention saw the necessity of granting to the Congress the power of
exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the whole district in
which the city was to be created, to preclude the possibility of there ever
being a conflict of jurisdiction. The power of Congress in this, as in
every other case, cannot extend beyond the grant expressed in the
fundamental law, whence all its powers, its very existence, emanate. In
other words, Congress is but an agency, created by a written special
power of attorney; and so far as the agent departs from the expressed
powers granted therein, his acts are void ab initio, and without validity
Now the people of the United States constitute the principal who executed
the instrument, (which, as to the powers of Congress, contains no clause
of substitution;) and the Federal City belonging to them, its inhabitants
are but their stewards, subject to their will, through the Congress, who
can only represent that will. And such I deem the true doctrine.that lies
at the foundation of a representative DEMOCRACY. But enough! I am
aware that it is quite supererogant to argue such points to your honorable
bodies; still the anomalous character of Washington as the seat of such
a government, and the language made use of in that greatest of all
charters upon whichl the whole government is constructed, and could not
exist without for a moment; the conflicts of jurisdiction that have evidently
occurred, as I shall attempt to show; the confusion and dissatisfaction apparent in the community composed of its citizens-point in my judgment
to the propriety and practicability, also, of a recision of its charter altogether, as the most certain remedy for all the existing and growing evils
I will now proceed to review some of the leading occurrences, which in
my opinion create the necessity of adopting the course recommended.
The plan of the city was evidently designed to be what it has already
become, the capital of a great nation, but from its very dimensions
oppressive to the inhabitants, if its improvements are to be thrown upon
them.   Besides the United States not only obtained this large domain
for nothing, but was paid greatly beyond its intrinsic value for taking it;
yet to this day, with millions of dollars worth of property upon it, they
have contributed nothing by way of taxation for the support of their own
city, while I am informed that they do pay taxes on their property at
other points, and the money applied to the ordinary purposes of the
places where the property is situated. The government has established
its title by having exercised ownership over the streets and avenues,
in closing them and selling the ground that formed them; it has changed
their position in other instances, and of the canal, and retained the lots
of ground opened thereby; and the Supreme Court has sustained its
authority in so doing-all of which clearly establishes the title in fee in
the United States. Sen. Doc. 97, 2d Sess. 23d Cong., 4 Peters R. 232.
I will not trouble you with matters of mere debit and credit, that have
been accumulating between the government and city ever since it was incorporated, and now quite volumnious; as my object is not to censure or
exculpate either party, but simply to lay before you some of the more
important leading facts and occurrences, best calculated, in my judgment,
to show the working of the machinery of government as administered upon
the corporation, that you may be able the better to judge, whether this
great Metropolis, as well as the true interests of the nation, do not imp</P><P><PB
ID="p00190019" N="19"> 
periously demand some change, or modification, at least, in the relations
as they now exist between these politic and corporate jurisdictions.
In a statement made to Congress, in January, 1848, by a select committee of the corporate authorities of Washington, with the Mayor of
the city at its head, among a long array of grievances set up against the
government in not bearing its just proportion of the expense in opening,
extending, and repairing streets and avenues; supporting schools for the
education of poor children, &amp;c., &amp;c.; it is asserted that the government
was obligated to expend the proceeds of the sales of its building-lots in
improving the streets and avenues, and that $800,000 had then been
paid into the treasury of the United States on account of such sales;
that it had given away $70,000 worth to charitable and literary institutions, and that a considerable number of lots still remained unsold.
These important facts, with many others of minor consequence, stated
by the committee, appears to have led to a revision of the charter, which
was approved May 17, 1848- in the 12th section of which it is "enacted, that the Commissioner of Public Buildings, or other officer having
charge and authority over the lands and property of the United States,
lying within the city of Washington, shall from time to time cause to be
opened and improved such avenues and streets, or parts or portions
thereof, as the President of the United States, upon application of the
corporation of said city, shall deem necessary for the public convenience,
and direct to be done; and he shall defray the expenses thereof out of
any money arising, or which shall have arisen, from the sale of lots in
the city of Washington, belonging, or which may have belonged, to the
United States, and from no other fund."  Then follows a similar provision in respect to making repairs; and the last section contains a repealing clause, whereby there can be no law, prior to that date, in conflict with it.-9 Stat. at Large, 228, et seq.
Here, then, some eleven years ago, a fund amounting to $870,000 was
designed by law for opening and repairing streets and avenues, not one
dollar of which can I find to have been used for such a purpose, but
merely the amount of the subsequent sales of lots. Listen to what your
Commissioner of the Public Buildings said, in his report of last year to
the Department of the Interior on the subject: "The improvements
provided for in section 15 of the city charter, approved May 15,
1820, and section 12 of the amended charter, approved May 17,
1848, are indispensable, and as the source from which the means to pay
for them were to flow has dried up, it strikes me that there is no other
alternative but for the government to make a small annual appropriation
for the purpose."-Page 11. On page 10, he said: "The city has
taken upon itself to open and grade the streets under the authority given
to it by the government, but is unwilling to do anything to the avenues."
"This unwillingness proceeds from a want of ample means, and a strong
conviction that the government is bound in justice, as its share, to con struct the avenues." Hear, also, what the Secretary himself says in
his Report to the President of last year. His remarks on the subject are
chiefly on page 13. I will quote but one paragraph: "In conferring
these powers upon the corporation, [those referred to by the Commissioner]
Congress must have acted on the conviction that it was the duty of the
city, and not of the general government, to open and repair streets and
avenues, as well as to make the other improvements indicated."</P><P><PB
ID="p00200020" N="20"> 
20
But who is to foot the bills?. The law says these improvements shall
be directed to be' executed "by the President of the United States, upon
application of the corporation of said city," which the law presumes to
be familiar with the wants of its constituency, whereupon it simply
acquaints the President of the fact, and, if convinced of the expediency,
he orders the work to be done.  I believe it is a rule of law, that the
power'to command a performance, carries with it every obligation arising
out of that performance.   And, I understand, there are two systems of
grades in this devoted city of Washington, which conflict at the intersections of streets and avenues-the one conducted by a city engineer, and
the other by an engineer employed by the government.   If this condition of things be in accordance with the municipal laws, then we have
two conflicting jurisdictions conducting affairs at' the seat of the govern
ment of the United States!'  An  Imperiumr in Imperio: "a wheel
within a wheel;" but, contrary to the laws of mechanics, the inner acting independent of the outer:   The city has taken upon ITSELF to open andgrade
the streets under the authority of the government, but is UNWILLING to do
anything to the AVENUES. Thus reports your own officer, whose duties acquaint him with the facts, which, unless I am egregiously mistaken, more
than sustain the report: The frequent changes of grades, also, superadded,
and all the consequent incertitude, affects seriously the value of property,
retards improvement, and injures the character of your city generally.
The individual who obtrudes his opinions thus before you is one of a
very few independent beings, who, though a native, does not belong to
your constituency, nor does he reside in the United States, or in the imperium in Imperio above spoken of; but in that terra ineognita alluded
to by the ancients (though fabulotus, of course,) as a region containing ten
miles square; he is merely "a looker-on here in Vienna;" but being unwilling to exagerate the existing evils, refrains from finishing the quotation.
Hie, therefore, will content himself by again urging a recision of the charter;
or such a modification of it as shall tax all property within the limits of the
corporation alike, for municipal support-the government of the United
States keeping the reins securely in hand over the eminent domain.
If, however, the foregoing views, in your superior wisdom, are deemed
inadmissible, then I would respectfully suggest that the government, at
least, resume full authority over streets and avenues; that their grades
may be determined with a view to the health, convenience, and beauty of
the city; and never afterwards to be disturbed, prejudicial to private
rights vested upon them. I would further suggest that the sum of $870,000, which seems to stand justly to the credit of these improvements, or
so much of it as has not, in the language of your Commissioner, already
been dried up, be funded, and the interest set apart annually for opening, improving, and keeping in repair streets and avenues, and in case of
an overplus, to be used in embellishing the public grounds, in accordance
with said streets and avenues.
I would further respectfully recommend the appointment of two superintendents-one of streets and avenues, whose duty it should be to employ a competent engineer to survey the streets and avenues; to fix their
grades, with profile drawings showing the inequalities of surface and the
angles of the grades; to make return of the work to the Department of</P><P><PB
ID="p00210021" N="21"> 
the Interior, and when approved by the President of the United States,
to be recorded in a book, kept in the office of the Superintendent, open
to public examination, and all the grades so approved and recorded, to
be declared fixed and unalterable forever. The other, to superintend the
public grounds and drainage of the city; to employ an engineer, and
whenever the grades of streets or avenues are to be united with the
grounds or drains, the Superintendents to consult together, and if they
disagree, that each stall severally state his own views to the President, whose
decision to govern both, and be final. And in the performance of all their
work, to purchase the necessary animals, implements, and materials, and to
hire the necessary human labor for the accomplishment of their several undertakings,iand to make returns thereof to the Department of the Interior.
In the foregoing attempt to describe a system of improvement suited to
the Capital of the United States, my analysis has led to so many divisions,
that I fear I have scarcely traced intelligible outlines of all the objects
introduced; exposing the whole to the sneers of the neophyte whose
hypercriticisms would rather demolish than build up; destroy than create.
I therefore beg your indulgence a little longer, that I may explain more
fully the reason for volunteering to trouble you thus, with a few remarks
upon the general effects expected to be ultimately produced throughout
the country, by carrying out the whole system; that I may feel the
greater confidence in seeking a refuge under the broad panoply of your
favorable opinion, as a shield from every insidious attack-personal or
otherwise; and in the hope that the cause that I am pleading may be the
better entitled to your favorable decision also.
Leisure and inclination have combined to lead me along for years,
through the intricate yet pleasant mazes of Botany. As "a labor of love,"
the study of botany has chained me to the midnight lamp, or lured me
through the perfumed air, "over the hills and far away," until weariness
would come to cool enthusiasm.  It has constituted my greatest enjoyment,
during a twenty years' residence here in the District of Columbia-a period
fraught with manifold afflictions, which withdrew me from the antagonisms of a wrangling world into the willing obscurity of the more congenial
fireside associations-social and contemplative. With such a bent and
bias, it will not appear singular, while living so near, that I should have
meditated often upon those great improvements, which, to my vision,
were to render the city of Washington that which every American citizen
must desire it to become as his Metropolis-the coronal "of our own native land;" and, among nations, the brightest gem of empire.
With their refining influence such improvements become the medium,
also, of enlarging the field of productive labor, as nurseries of the arts
and sciences necessary to a thorough knowledge of agriculture, horticulture, arboriculture, floriculture; in fine, of botany, with its numerous
correlatives, the acquisition of which would add more to the national
wealth, to the quiet, home fireside enjoyments of city and country through out this broad land, than all other learned professions put together, with
politics superadded.   There are, I admit, agriculturists, so called by the
million, but whose skill seems to consist only in devising the shortest and
surest method of exhausting, instead of sustaining the virgin soils, the
value of which exceeds the powers of computation!
And where can you find a thoroughbred native gardener? In the</P><P><PB
ID="p00220022" N="22"> 
words of Ovid, he is rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima sygno. We
have an abundance of seminaries of learning, deluging the land with
drones from the patent hives of literature, too proud to labor, and yet too
poor to live honestly without it. There are, also, our Military and Naval
schools, more practical and useful, which tend to elevate the national
character in the different branches of the science of war; but we have no
public institutions for the tuition of gardeners. And yet I will venture
to assert that there are no acquisitions so broadly based upon the arts and
sciences as those of an accomplished gardener.  You may meet occasion ally with a native amateur horticulturist, florist, &amp;c., like myself, who has
been impelled forward by an innate love of botany despite the throes of
society, big with a KANSAS, or an UTAH!  You will, also, meet with a few
commercial gardens scattered over the older and more populous States,
that have sufficient merit to deserve the patronage that supports them.
But they are mostly owned and managed by foreigners, whose manners,
and modes of teaching are not sufficiently attractive to the American
youth to popularize the pursuit, and place it where it should be placed,
high among the scientific pursuits of the country. This will be difficult
to accomplish under the present frame-work of our social state, that
stigmatizes three-fourths of our population with the opprobrious epithet of
clodhopper; which our own great lexicographer defines to mean, a clown;
a dolt; a thick-skull; a blockhead; a stupid fellow! And I, the moralist, take upon myself to add, as the only mitigation to this fulsome array,
an honest man. But establish national and state agricultural and botanical schools, with arboretums, and collections in natural history, and,
depend upon it, these degrading terms will be exhaled like the foul mists
of night by the first rays of the morning sun, while the integrity will remain a refreshing dew to excite this new growth in the right direction.
Your graduate should not only know how to till the ground, but to perfect
every thing that grows out of the ground, from the tenderest, or most
obscure exotic through every gradation of vegetation to a drumhead cabbage. And such establishments here under the patronage of the government, would give them popularity and impetus throughout the whole country.
The grounds I have selected for these purposes seem designed by the
Creator expressly for them, and nothing else, as very little can be found
anywhere in their whole extent, (except in section one,) that presents a
desirable site for a residence, and that little is more or less exposed to
miasmate&gt;; while all the rest lie too low and unsightly. Besides, the
main drains of the city must pass through the lowest ground, and under
ground, and any other way than I have pointed out, without detriment to
a building surface, would require many separate acqueduets, varying in
velocity so as to distribute the floods, or overflows from back-water would
be inevitable; yet very little of this necessary space would be wanted ten
days in the whole year-leaving these conduits, during the other 355
days, mere cavernous receptacles of unimaginable filth, without a sufficiency
of water during the warm dry seasons to keep them cleansed.
YOU REQUIRE TOO MUCH GROUND.
Who says so? Or, who is most likely to say so? Not the laboring
artisans of our cities will ever say so. Was complaint ever heard from
the poorest or the most avaricious inhabitant of London, of her four or</P><P><PB
ID="p00230023" N="23"> 
five thousand acres of pleasure grounds being too much? So far from it,
they would be the very first to rebel against any attempt to rob them of
such great treasures, where the peer, even royalty herself, and the humblest peasant, enjoy equal freedom. The same free use, and probably of
as great extent in comparison to population, is enjoyed in all the large
cities throughout Europe. The laboring classes find there a short respite
from toil, where, under the bright canopy of heaven and the umbrage of
trees, they can "breathe more freely,' and without charge imbibe health,
pleasure, and instruction. Shall we, the inhabitants of so vast a territory, be more covetous of a few dirty acres (some very very dirty) than
those hampered up islanders-than all the world beside? I call, then,
on the objector to point out the city if he can that is incommoded by too
much space for such purposes.
BUT YOU DISMEMBER THE CITY.
You make it truly a city of hamlets  at "magnificent distances."
"Ha, ha! and art thou there, Truepenny?"  This objection belongs to
those who look upon all cities as only marts for merchandize, aud whose
taste would bring the picturesque undulations which originally pervaded
the city, to a mere droy-horse level-a taste unfortunately too prevalent
with its inhabitants, and which some of the objects in view are intended
to correct. But was not the city designed to be more or less dismembered in a commercial point of view?  Nature herself made the divisions
which I would unite by an appropriate application of them.  Look at the
morasses that even now divide the city from north to south, and from the
very foot of your capitol to the Potomac and along its margin to the west,
all of which your very halls overlook, whence at times you may scent the
fetid air engendered there. The very width of its avenues and streets,
and their local connections at conspicuous and remote points, the mall and
the public reservations, as originally traced, all bespeak the design of its
founder, and the desecrations that sordid avarice has already traced too
indellibly upon them. And is it not plain even now, with the Vandal
marks upon it, that Washington was never designed to be, and never can
become, a commercial city? But I would not disconnect any portion of
the city or surrounding country from their true interests with the whole,
which I trust a comparison of my diagram with the plan of the city, and
with all the thoroughfares leading into it, will render too plain to require
further elucidation. And as a further bond of unity, I would have constructed throughout the public grounds a complete connection of carriage
and equestrian roads.  They should be kept separate even at the gates,
and made wide enough to admit carriages and cavalcades to pats each
other without danger from collision. In the directions given to such
roads, as also of the walks for pedestrians, a motive for every curve should
be apparent; as where objects invite close inspection, and in different
4spects or attitudes, or should be avoided, or passing through the lower
evels where little ofl interest is looked for, suggest straighter lines with
accelerated movement; all of which, with many other causes, might vary
heir length in accordance with the number, relative position, and impoit*nce of the intervening objects. These should be disposed so as to keep
,p sufficient interest to lead on the learned and the curious to the utmost
imits of the grounds; while to the invalid, seeking only the prescribed
23</P><P><PB ID="p00240024" N="24"> 
quantum of exercise, the many points of ingress and egress leave distance
and direction quite optional. The walks for pedestrians necessarily lead
to closer views of objects and localities.
You may, perhaps, be told that the broad avenues and streets of the
city of Washington, with their small squares, circles, and triangles, that
mark their intersections, skirted with trees, were intended  for pleasure
drives, and ample for such a purpose; while, in my view, instead of being
drives of pleasure, they are but drives to pleasure and the avenues of
business. Who will look for pleasure amid squealing swine and cackling
geese, of oyster horns and squalling children? But, says the advocate,
all this will be expelled from the streets whenever the increase of population shall demand it. Very well; but in their place you will have the
increased bustle, noise, dust, and turmoil of a crowded city. And though
the lean, lank trees that fringe the streets are useful as screens to houses
along them from the intensity of the summer heat, and to shade also the
glowing pavements, still they are but meager specimens compared with
those planted with the view to a perfect development, and with every
means provided to that end.
CONCLUSION.
If the ialprovements I have so poorly described, or any like them, are
ever to take place, means should be adopted at once to secure all the
ground that will be required. A system consisting of so many parts, like
beauty in architecture, must depend on symmetrical proportion for effect
as a whole. If, therefore, the plan be carried on by piecemeal, from year
to year, as has been suggested, the charms of maturity will be sure to be
lost in heterogeneous combinations. The first step, then, will be to cancel the private titles within the prescribed limits, and the sooner the better for all concerned; for many might delay improvements, while others
see their interest in forcing them forward, in anticipation of the demand,
and the price of all be enhanced by the public expectation. This step, if
promptly taken, would save an immense sum of.money to the government
and enhance the value of property more equally and extensively over the
citX than will ever be effected in any other way: breaking down the local
west end or east end influences that are as sure to exist as individual
wealth is prone to such investments. The ordinary rise of property, also,
will probably exceed for years to come the rate of interest, should the
government have to borrow the whole amount.  And that amount will not
appear so formidable, after deducting the reservations, streets, and avenues, included in the grounds; for but little of the remainder is built
upon, and still less in its present condition would ever-justify building
expensively.  Governments are perpetual; time,'therefore, as to them,
is to be considered as only~commensurate with great national undertakings.
The object of the foregoing essay is not so much to carry out my views
as to offer them to the public scrutiny, for the purpose of agitating the
public mind in favor of improvements that shall make our metropolis as
far transcend as it now sinks below all parallel, and to urge the necessity
of immediate action; for whatever it may be, "'twere well it were done
quickly."  I therefore close in the words of Horace:
-    Si quid novisti rectius istis.
Candidus imteArt si non his utere mecum.
