PROCEEDINGS.
AGREEABLY to previous notice, a meeting of the colored citizens
of Boston was held in the Southac Street Church, on Monday evening, Dec. 17th, 1855, for the purpose of presenting a testimonial
to Mr. WrILLIAM C. NELL, for his disinterested and untiring exertions in procuring the opening of the public schools of the city
to all the children and youth within its limits, irrespective of complexional differences. The church was crowded by a finely-appearing and evidently intelligent audience, all of whom appeared to take
a lively interest in the proceedings.
At half-past seven, the beneficiary was escorted into the church
by the Committee of Arrangements, viz.: Mrs. Joanna Turpin
Howard, Mrs. Caroline Butler Lewis, Mrs. Eliza B. Bisbitt, Mrs.
Georgiana 0. Smith, and Mr. Nelson L. Perkins.  Mr. Perkins
called the meeting to order, which was organized by the choice of
the following officers: -

Prayer was offered by Rev. CHARLE,S W. UPHAM, (editor of the
Christia~i Iatchman,) after which the President briefly addressed
the assembly, alluding to the various efforts which had been made
for the overthrow of the obnoxious and disgraceful caste school, to
the shameful abuse with which these efforts had too often been met,
by members of SchooI Committees and others, and to the persistent
andl patient labors of the friends of the movement, which had at
B::]hsr been brought to a triumphant termination.  Among those who
,      remained faithful to the end, (he said,) might be named WIL   LIAM C. NELL, (applause); who, like Moses of old, would not be
put off, but, seeing the suffering and hearing the sighing of the
children of his brethren, was moved in his inmost soul to resolve
that they should not suffer the shame much longer, if any devotion
and energy on his part could accomplish their deliverance. With
this determination, he went forward, making all the efforts necessa   ry in the case, until success had crowned his labors; and the meet   ing that evening was for the purpose of presenting to him a testimo    nial of their appreciation and gratitude. (Loud applause.)
FLORAL PRESENTATION.
-Mrs. CAlLINE BUTLEI LEwis then came forward and sang a
floral invocation, which was repeatedly applanuded, and at its conclusion, Master FnRDERIcK LEWIS, in behalf of the children who
have been so highly benefitted by Mr. Nell's labors, addressed him
as follows: -
", Champion of Equal School Rights, we hail thee!  With  unbounded gratitude we bow before thee! Our youthful hearts bless
thee for thy incessant labors and untiring zeal in our behalf. We
would fain assist in swelling thy praise, which flows from every lip,
but this were a tribute far too small.  Noble friend! thou hast
opened for us the gate that leadeth to rich treasures; and as we
pass through, Ambition lendeth us a hand - ay, she quickeneth our
pace; and as, obeying her, we look through the vista of future
years, we recognise bright Fame in a field of literary glory, her
right hand extended with laurels of honor, to crown those who
shall be most fortunate in gaining the platform whereon she standeth; while before her is spread the banquet, with viands rich and
rare, that our literary hunger may be satiated. To this we aspi-'
I
I I</P><P><PB ID="p00030003" N="3">

To gain this, we will be punctual to school, diligent in study, and
well behaved; and may we be enabled to reach the goal, that, in
thy declining years, thy heart may be gladdened by what thine eye
beholdeth, and it shall be like a crown of gold encircling thy head,
and like a rich mantle thrown around thee, studded with jewels and
precious stones.
"Kind benefactor! accept, we entreat thee, this simple token,
emblem of the bright, gladsome years of youthful innocence and
purity; and as thou hast befriended us, so may we ever prove
faithful friends to thee!  May the blessings of Heaven attend thee
through life's ever-changing scenes and intricate windings, is our
prayer.
"Long live William C. Nell, the noble champion of Eqtual School
Righyts! "  (Prolonged cheering.)
On the conclusion of his address, Master Lewis presented Mr.
Nell with a beautiful bouquet, and several other children, - Elizabeth Smith, Clarence Howard, Adeline Howard, Charles Guess,
Anne Steamburg, Julia Bailey, and Ira Nell Gray,- came forward,
each bearing a similar offering. This scene was an exceedingly
pleasant one, and the audience expressed their gratification in
repeated cheers.
PRESENTATION OF AN ELEGANT GOLD WATCH.
Mrs. GEOR0GIANA O. SMITE then, in the following well-spoken
address, presented to Mr. Nell a very fine and costly gold watch, as
a token of the regard and esteem of his friends, in whose behalf he
had so perseveringly labored:
MR. NELL, -D EAR SIR, - It is with feelings of the deepest
emotion that I, in behalf of the colored citizens of Boston, appear
before you this evening, to present you this watch, as a token of our
esteem and respect for your untiring exertions in securing Equal
School Rights for the colored children of the city of Boston.
Sir, it would be difficult for me to describe the heartfelt feelings
of respect and gratitude our colored friends of Boston entertain for
you; - you, who were never known to swerve from your course,
but were always ready when an opportunity occurred to plead and
battle for the rights of the people with whom you are identified;
you, who were never weary or disheartened, even when the battle</P><P><PB ID="p00040004" N="4"> 
4
raged fiercest, or the object at which you aimed seemed almost unattainable; even then you persevered, and those who met you, from
day to day, saw Hope seated upon your brow, and its light irradiating your countenance.  With you, there was " no such word as
fail."
And now, knowing these things to be so, I present to you this
token of our respect; and may the citizens of Boston always feel a
warm regard for this our tried and valued friend, and may the name
of WILLIAM C. NELL be handed down to posterity as the champion
of Equal School Rights!  (Loud cheers.)
The watch bears this inscription: -
"A Tribute to
WILLIAM C. NELL,
FROM THE COLORED CITIZENS OF BOSTON,
For his untiring efforts in behalf of
EQUAL SCHOOL RIGHTS,
Dec. 17, 1855."
ADDRESS OF MR. NELL.
MiR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
The struggle for Equal School Rights, which for so long a series
of years has taxed our hearts, our heads and our hands, having,
through the aid of many friends, at length been triumphantly suecessful, it was but natural that the gratitude of parents and children shnould desire to make some record of the emotions awakened
by such a signal and public good. With partial kindness, you have
been pleased to make me the recipient of these honors, in recognition of the humble services it was my privilege to render the cause
we all have loved so well.
Any attempt to express the feelings which swell my heart at
this, the proudest moment of my life, it is no affectation to say,
would be wholly unavailing. Your own hearts can best interpret
mine. To be surrounded by such a constellation of friends from
various walks of life, comprising those who have known me from
early boyhood, and those of but recent acquaintance- realizing the
fact that this is their united testimonial, approving my course in so
glorious a reform -to be elaborate on such a theme calls for abilities far transeending any that I possess. I should be doing injus</P><P><PB ID="p00050005" N="5"> 
5
tice, however, to my own sense of right, were I to allow the occasion
to pass without referring to others, whose words and deeds, in pro motion of the movement, should engrave their names indelibly upon
the tablets of our memory.
To secure accuracy of names and dates, I have committed them to
paper; but, anticipating the mental feast in reserve for us from the
distinguished friends who have graced our meeting with their pres ence, I will be as brief as the circumstances will admit.
In the year 1829, while a pupil in the basement story of the Bel knap-street church, Hon. Harrison Gray Otis, then Mayor of the
city, accompanied Hon. Samuel T. Armstrong to an examination of
the colored school. It chanced that Charles A. Battiste, Nancy
WVoodson and myself were pronounced entitled to the highest reward of merit.  In lieu of Franklin Medals, legitimately our due,
Mr. Armstrong gave each an order on Dea. James Loring's Bookstore for the Life of Benjamin Franklin. This is the copy I received! -[a diminutive 18 mo. edition, of some two hundred pages.]
The white medal scholars were invited guests to the Faneuil Hall
dinner.  Having a boy's curiosity to be spectator at the "feast of
reason and the flow of soul," I made good my court with one of the
waiters, who allowed me to seem to serve others as the fee for serving  myself, the physical being then with me subordinate.  Mr.
Armstrong improved a prudent moment in whispering to me, "You
ought to be here with the other boys." Of course, the same idea
had more than once been mine, but his remark, while witnessing
the honors awarded to white scholars, only augmented my sensitiveness all the more, by the intuitive inquiry, which I eagerly desired to express- "If you think so, why have you not taken steps
to bring it about?"
The impression made on my mind, by this day's experience, deepened into a solemn vow, that, God helping me, I would do my best
to hasten the day when the color of the skin would be no barrier to
equal school rights. I need not tell you, that it was several years
before any movement could be made promising a favorable result.
In the year 1840, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Francis
Jackson, Henry WV. Williams, and myself, signed a petition, asking
the City Government to grant equal school rights. Of course, but
little if any progress was made at that time. In the year 1846,
another petition was forwarded from George Putnam and eighty-five
others.  In 1849, Jonas W. Clark and 227 others renewed the</P><P><PB ID="p00060006" N="6"> 
6
appeal, which was urged through several years, attended with
agitations and occasional skilrmnishes, not always confined to our
white citizens, until, in May, 1854, George F. Williams, Esq., submitted an able report to the City Government, recommending equal
rights and equal privileges to colored children.  His efforts, responded to by a few members of each branch, paved the way for
that action in the succeeding Legislature which accomplished the
long-sought-for object. As a means to this end, petitions were circulated, and though but to a limited extent, it resulted in 1469
names being forwarded. Of this number, I had the honor of
obtaining 311 in Boston, which was augmented by 87, through the
exertions of our zealous friend, Lewis Hayden. It will not be
invidious to mention two places in the Commonwealth whose earlier
and successful struggles in the same reform prompted their ready
and cheerful cooperation with us. Wesley Berry headed the one
from Nantucket, and the name of Hon. Stephen C. Phillips, with
the leading clergymen and officials, graced the other from Salem,
with 114 names, -a success achieved by the joint labors of the wife
of Charles Lenox Remond, Mrs. George Putnam, formerly of this
city, and -Miss Charlotte L. Forten, pupil in the Normal School.
John B. Bailey and Peter Randolph, in Charlestown, were faithful
auxiliaries, and the exertions of white anti-slavery friends in East
Bridgewater, Lexington, Bolton and Leominster were no less
praiseworthy, some towns, including Lynn and Haverhill, sending
300 names and upwards.
These petitions were promptly responded to by the Legislature.
In the House, the bill was ordered to a third reading with an affirm ative shout, not more than half a dozen voting audibly in opposition.
The Senate as readily cooperated, and the Governor placed his sign
manual to the bill, April 28.
To the honor of that Legislature be it recorded, that equal school
rights found there a host of strong and valiant supporters; among
them, Mr. Kimball, of Salem, and that trio, including the member
from Essex, so like a Prince in defending Humanity's claim, that
eloquent and Swift witness against those who would despoil us of
our rights, and that other, last mentioned now, but more prominent
then than all, who was never Slack in fulfilling his promises, and
whose efforts continued until they were crowned with brilliant suc
cess.
The City Government, inspired by the State's laudable example,</P><P><PB ID="p00070007" N="7"> 
7
with commendable haste reversed the action of their predecessors,
and acceded to the proposition suggested by one influential member,
who remarked that " the colored people had in effect abolished the
school themselves, and it would be absurd to refuse to pass the
order;" and the vote wvas sustained by 38 yeas to 6 nays; -thus
confirming that saying of a wise man, " There are no limits to the
power of an intelligent and determined people." Fortunately, the
Bishtop who superintended at the city educational altar proffered his
willing heart and hand to secure to our children what the letter and
spirit of the law guaranteed.
D)'Aubigne, in his History of the Reformation, says, " Opinions
make their progress like the waters that trickle behind our rocks,
and loosen them from the mountains in which they rest; suddenly
the operation is revealed, and a single day suffices to lay bare the
work of years, if not of centuries." How beautifully has this
truth been illustrated in the reform we this evening meet to celebrate!- an accumulation of words and deeds dotting its whole
history to its culmination.
The two extremes of opinion on the Anti-Slavery question have
met in this discussion. Some have expressed opinions, legal and
otherwise, favorable to the right, who else had no affinity with the
Anti-Slavery cause,  We have profited by both.
Hon. Richard Fletcher, Hon. Charles H. Warren, John A. Bolles,
Esq., Hon. Stephen C. Phillips, Edmund Quincy, Rev. T. W. Higginson, Rev. Daniel Foster, Rev. E. A. Stockman, Rev. John T.
Raymond, Hon. Henry Wilson, Hion. C. T. Russell, acted in unison
in promoting this desirable object.
Hon. George S. Hillard and Rev. John T. Sargent, on one occasion, were the only two in the School Board to vote in our favor;
and Mr. Hillard, on several occasions since, when his legal duties
required otherwise, has volunteered his acquiescence in our appeal.
Benjamin F. Roberts, in 1849, instituted a suit against the city
for excluding his child from the public schools, which was nobly
defended by Hon. Charles Sumner, whose argument, though not
then influencing the Supreme Bench, had a most potent bearing on
the Legislature which granted our rights. Associated with him in
this case was Robert Morris, Esq., whose very presence as a colored
member of the Massachusetts Bar, was a living protest against all
exclusive colored institutions.
The brothers Francis and Edmund Jackson, and those other</P><P><PB ID="p00080008" N="8"> 
8
brothers, Henry I. and William I. Bowditch, each pair hike Dickens's brothers Cheeryble, were especially active, rivalling each
other in these kind offices.
John A. Andrew, with a keen eye to the emergency, amended
the legislative bill, making assurance doubly sure.
Wendell Phillips, Esq., from the moment of signing the first
petition with Wm. Lloyd Garrison, like him has always been ready,
in and out of season, with his rich gifts of voice and pen, before
legislative and other committees, to advocate our claims. Rev.
Theodore Parker, who stood side by side with Wendell Phillips in
those memorable struggles to rescue Thomas Sims and Anthony
Burns from the hell of American slavery, placed his name side by
side with that of Mr. Phillips on the Boston petition for equal
school rights; and, but for an imperative engagemernt on the part
of Mr. Parker, they would have been side by side here this evening,
to receive our unfeigned thanks for their abundant labors in this
cause.
William J. Watkins also buckled on his armor, and did most efficient service; and you, Sir, our worthy Chairman, your white
plume, like that of Henry IV. at the battle of Navarre, was always
seen at that point where the blows fell thick and fast in our defence.
I am aware how notorious it is that the good mani shrinks from the
open proclamation to his face of his really good qualities. But
while the friends present will not doubt my veracity in these statements, they, and those who have helped rear for us and our children
the Temple of Equality, will indulge me on this special occasion, in
view of the past, present, and future history of school rights. Let
us not forget to duly honor those who, by their exertions, have secured to us these blessings.
While I would not in the smallest degree detract from the credit
justly due the men for their conspicuous exertions in this reform,
truth enjoins upon me the pleasing duty of acknowledging that to
the wonen, and the children also, is the cause especially indebted for
success.
In the dark hours of our struggle, when betrayed by traitors within and beset by foes without, while some men would become lukewarm and indifferent, despairing of victory, then did the women keep
the flame alive, and as their hopes would weave bright visions for
the future, their husbands and brothers would rally for a new attack
upon the fortress of Colorphobia.  Yes, Sir, it was the MOTHERS</P><P><PB ID="p00090009" N="9"> 
(God bless them!) of these little bright-eyecl boys and girls, who,
through every step of our progress, were executive and vigilant,
even to that memorable Monday morning, (Sept. 3, 1855,) the trial
hour, when the colored children of Boston went up to occupy the
long-promised land. It was these mothers who accompanied me to
the various school-houses, to residences of teachers and committee men, to see the laws of the Old Bay State applied in good faith.
An omnipresent consciousness of my own experience when a
school-boy, and how my heart would have leaped in the enjoyment
then of equal school rights, has proved a strong incentive to my
interest for your boys and girls; for, having none of my own, I took
the liberty of adopting them all as my children,- and the smiles of
approbation with which so many of them have greeted me in their
homes and the highways and byways of life, have imparted to me a
wealth of inspiration and encouragement not obtainable from any
other source.  He that makes glad the heart of a child, receives in
return whole volumes of benedictions, and is richer far than if upon
his brow were entwined a monarch s diadem.
These mothers have also labored at home to instil into the minds
of their children the necessity of striving to obtain, as also to ap preciate, those rights, - emulating that New England mother who
was said to mingle instruction ill her children's bread and milk, and
put good morals into their apple pies! WTith commendable zeal,
the boys and girls have endeavored to profit by these counsels.
On the morning preceding their advent to the public schools, I
saw from my window a boy passing the exclusive Smith School,
(where he had been a pupil,) and, raising his hands, he exultingly
exclaimed to his companions, " Good bye for ever, colored school!
To-mnorrowo we are like other Boston boys."
In my daily walks, I behold the companionship, in studies and
healthful glee, of boys and girls of all colors and races in these temples of learning, so justly a theme of pride to every citizen; sights
and sounds indeed to me chief among ten thousand, and altogether
lovely. And since the 3d of September to the present time, the
sun, moon and stars are regular in their courses! No orb has
proved so eccentric as to shoot madly from its sphere in consequence, and the State IHouse on Beacon Hlill, and old Faneuil Hall,
remain as firm on their bases as ever
This union of mothers and children with husbands and fathers
has contributed vastly to the great result. They have been the
allied forces which conquered our Sevastopol.

To the colored boys and girls of Boston it may now in truth be
said, The lines have fallen to you in pleasant places. Behold, you
have a goodly heritage! May it stimulate you to heed the voice of
Wisdom, as she sweetly offers the choicest treasures of her gathered
stores:
"With eager hand the glowing page to tunl,
To scan the earth and cleave the distant sky, -
And find the force that holds the planets in their spheres."
Do not waste your spring of youth in idle dalliance, but plant
rich seeds to blossom in your manhood, und bear fruit when you are
old. The public schools of Boston are the gateways to the pursuits
of honor and usefulness, and if rightly improved by you, the imagination almost wearies as future prospects dawn upon its vision; for
"Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise."
In response to your floral tribute, so pleasing and acceptable, allow
me to say, that I needed it not as an evidence of your satisfaction
with the rights obtained, or my participancy therein, for the pleasure of the service has abundantly rewarded me. Endeavor to
retain the impressions made upon your memories by this meeting,
for, after all, you children are the parties benefitted. Your parents
have labored to achieve this good for you, and to them you must
ever render due honor. The three children of an Eastern lady were
invited to furnish her with an expression of their love before she
went on a long journey. One brought a marble tablet, with the
inscription of her name; another presented her with a garland of
flowers; the third entered her presence, and thus accosted her:"Mother, I have neither marble tablet nor fragrant nosegay, but I
have a heart. Here your name is engraved; here your name is precious; and this heart, full of affection, will follow you wherever
you travel, and remain with you wherever you repose." I know of
no more appropriate advice to boys and girls than to commend their
imitation of that child's example; and when a few short years shall
have rolled away, and all proscription shall have done its work in
the land, may
"You love at times to pause, and strew the way
With the wild flowers that luxuriant pend
From Spring's gay branches, that whene'er you send
Your Memory to retrace your pilgrimage,
She by those flowers her winding course may bend,
Back through each twilight and each weary stage,
And with those early flowers wreathe the white brow of age.'</P><P><PB ID="p00110011" N="11"> 
11
I could cull from my chapter of experience and observation many
an unkind and insulting remark uttered against the rights of colored
children in Boston, by school-committee men, editors, and others
occupying responsible positions; but, as they can be reserved for
future use, to "point a moral," if not to " adorn a tale," let us, in
this hour of victory, be magnanimous enough to cover with the
charity of our silence, the names of all who have opposed us.
MADAM: In accepting this elegant token from your hands, I am
not vain enough to monopolize the honor and gratitude so eminently due to those I have mentioned, and others who have promoted
this great work.  Let it be regarded as a joint offering to them all,
to be held in trust by me only so long as I am faithful to the elevation of those with whom I am identified by complexion and condition- the cause of humanity.
May we all Watch each other, that our hands may be diligent
our hours consecrated, each nun'~ite, indeed, every second in that
movement upon our dial-plate, indicating a chain of Human Brotherhood. The associations of this evening will be my main-spring,
henceforward - its recollections more fragrant than choiceflowers -
ever-enduring as time!  Friends, go on!
"Oft as the memories of this hour return,
,Iay friendship's flame within your bosoms burn,
And hand in hand, improvement's course pursue,
Till scenes of earth have faded from your view;
Then your glad spirits, freed from bonds of clay,
Shall soar triumphant to the home of day
Where softer dews than lIermon's give perfume
To flowers sweeter than in Sharon bloom;
Entrancing music breathe in airs divine,
And toil no10 more the spirit's flight confiine;
But ever onwards through its bright abode,
Bask in the presence of its Maker, God."
Mr. Nell's address was frequently interrupted by applause, especially at the mention of those anti-slavery friends who had given
their aid to the cause.
SPEECH OF CHARLES W. SLACK.
CIRARLES WV. SLACK, Esq., of Boston, was then introduced to
the audience, and welcomed with hearty and enthusiastic cheers.
He said he should not detain them long from the treat which he</P><P><PB ID="p00120012" N="12"> 
12
knew they were anticipating in the addresses of those who were to
follow him.  He had come there, as they had, simply to express his
kindly feeling towards the beneficiary of the evening, - their friend,
WVM. C. NELL, -who, as they all knew from their own observation and experience, had been long engaged in the cause of equal
school rights for colored youth. He (Mr. S.) felt that this was an
evening of jubilee; that they ought all to be thankful that one
more prejudice was at last driven from the sanction of the city of
Boston. (Cheers.)  How singular it was, as had been well remarked
on another occasion by the worthy pioneer in the Anti-Slavery
cause, [Wm. LLOYD GARRISON,] that when, after long years of toil
and sacrifice, a victory has been achieved, it has seemed as though
1o one cared at all for what had been done! It had been especially
so with regard to the colored race. The idea had been rigidly entertained by a large portion of the community, that there was something repulsive in having the little children of color sit side by side
with those of white parents in the public schools; but when the
reform was accomplished, - when, on the first Monday of September last, these bright little ones about us went up, with equal privileges and equal freedom, to the common schools, although, for a
moment, there was a slight buzz of astonishment at the unusual
spectacle, the next day it had all passed away, and they were met
as gladly by teachers and pupils as any other children. He had
just been told by one of the School Committee present on the occasion, [HENRY  YPIAM, Esq.,] that the teachers in those schools
where the colored children are the more numerous, report that they
come as neatly dressed, and are as gifted in application and understanding, as the children of parents who have had all the advantages
which wealth, position and culture could give! (Applause.)
We'll, this prejudice against colored children in the public schools
has been driven out of sight- thank God for that! (Cheers.)  It
was another of the triumphs which had marked the struggle for the
elevation of the colored race in this Commonwealth. First came
the abrogation of the laws against intermarriage -not that many
desired that privilege, but they could not consent that a mark of
inequality should be placed upon either race, white or black; then
the " Jim Crow" car was abolished, and the privilege of travel in
every public conveyance fully maintained; then the places of
amusement were thrown open to the colored race equally with the
white; then followed, in Boston, the abolition of the "negro pew"</P><P><PB ID="p00130013" N="13"> 
13
in the City Directory, and the record of all the citizens alike, without distinction of color or race; and now, to crown the whole, we
have established the right of the humblest child in the community
to all the benefits of our common-school education, equally with the
offspring of the 1 roudest citizen in the Commonwealth.
He (Mr. S.) regarded this reform only as the stepping-stone to
other successes. He hoped the time was not far distant when we
should see our colleges and higher seminaries of learning graced by
the sable countenances of those who had heretofore been proscribed;
and with this recognition of the manhood of the colored race, we
should have further advancement in the same direction. By thus
recognising their rights in every sphere of life, something would be
done towards breaking down that great system of human servitude
which is the shame of our land. (Cheers.)
He had remarked on a former occasion, that it was a very singular and somewhat unexpected thing to find so many anti-slavery
men in the last Legislature.  ite did not know how it happened,whether by the providence of God or the accident of politics,- but
they got there, and (having an instinctive consciousness that they
might never get there again) some of them resolved, if there was
any way in which they could make their mark on that Legislature,
they would do it! (Loud and prolonged cheering.) Nationally,
they thought they had accomplished their mission when they elected
HENRY WILSON (cheers) to the United States Senate.  That, however, was done so easily, they thought they might try the temper of
the House a little further; and so an Address was presented for the
official decapitation of Judge Loring, for his unseemly participation
in the rendition of Anthony Burns. All knew what was the result
of that measure; but he believed that if, under the Constitution,
the Legislature had had the power, they would have carried that
Address through by a two-thirds vote, over the veto of the Governor, as they did, a little later, the Personal Liberty Bill. These
measures disposed of, the anti-slavery members cast about for something that should indicate their direct connection with the colo)red
race, and they found nothing that seemed better suited for their
advocacy, than the measure for securing equal school rights to all
the children in the Commonwealth. And when Mr. Nell came up
with his huge budget of papers, it was a very simple thing to put
the manifold testimony he brought into the shape of a "Report,"
and present it to the House. It was as if an enterprising builder</P><P><PB ID="p00140014" N="14"> 
14
should bring his timber and bricks and mortar into the street, and
then, calling in his master-workman, should say to him - "Here, I
have got all the material and implements ready, and will furnish
the capital needed; now go on and erect the building." It would
be an easy matter to do so. And so Mr. Nell furnished all the materials and the capital in this case, and there had risen up, under
the direction of the master-workman of the Committee, this fair
fabric of equality in the education of the colored youth of this
Commonwealth.
In conclusion, Mr. Slack said -" Friends! I know you are all
pleased. We have done a good thing; and let us still continue our
efforts in the future, ever bearing in mind that we have other duties
to discharge in the same direction; and among them, as citizens of
a boasted free Republic, is, to proclaim, by act as well as voice, in
the language of our Declaration of Independence, that'ALL MER
ARE CREATED EQUAL.'" (Loud cheers.)
SPEECH OF WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.
Mr. PI{ILLIPS (who was received with loud cheers) said he
rejoiced very heartily in the occasion that called them together. It
was one of those rare days in the history of a hard struggle, when
there wes something palpable to rVjoice at. Men were always asking-What has the Anti-Slavery agitation done?  He was glad
they had this answer to make now -It has opened the schools:
for he supposed every one would be willing to allow, that without
this agitation of the public mind, on the general question, the doors
of the schools would never have been opened. When he first took
hold of this enterprise, he believed the colored people would never
obtain equality in the Senate-house until they got it on the schoolbench; and when they got it on the school-bench, if they improved
their privileges, they might force what they chose from the community.  But two things rule in this country-brains, and money;
and brains make money, too, therefore, they are the better. The
common schools give one the free and best use of his brains, now,
having that, let the colored man get the money; and then he need
not ask the white race to let him be equal, for when the white
man found the man of color passing him in the race, he would
whisper   " By-the-by, that fellow is fully my equal." (Applause.)
He was glad this reform had been carried for another reason.</P><P><PB ID="p00150015" N="15"> 
15
lie was tirel of having Mlr. Nell come to him with his petitions.
(Laughter.)  Mr. Nell never could be found without them.  IHe
(Mr. P.) was glad he had got rid of him, and was quite willing to
take free schools instead.
This victory over which they had met to rejoice was indeed a
great gain; it was a basis for something else, and something better
still. This struggle reminded him to urge upon them union among
themselves wherever their rights were concerned. He remembered
that, on one occasion, when, with two or three others, he went up
before a Senate Committee, they drafted a bill which the friends of
equal rights knew would not secure their object, and they told the
Committee so. But the Chairman of the Committee, a Boston lawyer, said - "I know it; but you know, as well as I do, that Boston
has determined to have colored schools, law or no law, and you will
take that law or none." That man was reelected to the Legislature
by the colored men of Boston! Had they thrown a united vote
against him, the man who had thus dared to insult them through
their representatives would never have entered that State House
again; and his absence would have been the best argument that
could have been offered for giving to colored citizens their rights.
The opposition to this movement always came from the city of
Boston. Hie remembered that at one time he appeared before a Legislative Committee, when the Chairman came from the Connecticut
Valley, and as he (Mr. P.) began to show that colored schools were
illegal, the Chairman interrupted him by saying - "You need not
undertake to prove that I have got a nose on my face.  Show me
that such schools exist, and I will report such a bill as you desire."
Nevertheless, his report was worth nothing, for the Boston members opposed it.
The best thing learned by these struggles is, how to prepare for
another. They were in for the war. Hie should never think Massachusetts a State fit to live in, until he saw one man, at least, as
black as the ace of spades, a graduate of Harvard College. (Cheers.)
He had no notion of such an empire as ours affected to be, confined
to one race - it is too narrow. He did not go for annexing territory only, but for annexing hearts- all sorts of races, all sorts of
customs. Let a man burn the dead body of his wife, if she desires
it! When they had high schools and colleges to which all classes
and colors were admitted on equal terms, then he should think
Massachusetts was indeed the noblest representative of the principles
that planted her.</P><P><PB ID="p00160016" N="16">

They were greatly indebted to the young man whom they had
met to honor. These reforms are apt to stop, when everybody's
business is nobody's business. They were none of them willing to
give the cheerless, disheartening toil, the unremitting industry, the
hope against hope, which he has given. If he had not been the
nucleus, there would have been no cause; if he had not gone up to
the Legislature, when it seemed mere impertinence to go there, nobody would have gone. He (Mr. P.) loved to have these hours,
when they could turn away from the battle, to do honor to the selfdevotion, to the life-long energy and true-heartedness of such a
man.  They knew that while many who started with him had been
turned aside by professional emolument, or private gain, he had
been true to his race, true to his idea.  Emerson had said -" A
Tory is a Democrat gone to seed." (Laughter.) Cold-hearted age
is the natural successor of enthusiastic youth. We see it so often, we
expect it. When he saw an old man with the lava of his young
enthusiasm just as hot, his confidence in the right just as loyal, his
determination to stereotype honest pulses into statutes, just as fixed,
as at nineteen, he was the man whom hlie would point the young to
imitate, and the old to try to go back and be like. (Loud cheers.)
We say sometimes, distrustfully, "This man has not attended to his
own interest; he did not know his own business; he would have
been a richer man if he had been more stingy." So he would!
It was our interests he was attending to; it was the foundation of
better times he was laying. It was not the want of sense, it was a
higher sense. Their friend Nell had invested his capital in the
children of his fellow-citizens, in the ideas which will prevail hereafter; and when he goes down to the grave, those whom he has
benefitted will remember and honor him, as one who trusted in the
honesty of Massachusetts, and who waited to prove she could be
just.
And here I wish to mention with fitting praise the volume,
"COLORED PATRIOTS OF TilE REVOLUTION," which Mr. Nell has
just published. The subject is one which has engaged his attention
for many years. The facts lay scattered and difficult of access.
With patient diligence, with a watchfulness which has never allowed
any opportunity to slip which promised him an addition to his materials, he has, like Scott's Old Mortality, done good service in perpetuating the memories, and refreshing our recollections of the good
deeds of those whose fame you ought not to let die. I commend</P><P><PB ID="p00170017" N="17"> 
17
his work most heartily to your patronage. Let it be so generous
that others of your young men may be encouraged to like efforts,
and specially to gather and preserve the materials for the History of
the Colored Race in the United States, - a story which, for thril ling interest and philosophical value will rarely, if ever, be equalled.
It is for you now to gather the materials for that History. I hope
your young men will make early use of their education and leisure
for that and similar purposes, even if, like Mr. Nell, they do so persevering alone, unaided, poor, and at their own cost. But it is in
your power to change this picture, and help them and him in these
labors by generous and sympathising aid.
There was another reason, Mr. Phillips said, why he rejoiced in
this triumph. Some seven years ago, he told the Legislature, when
he asked them to go for Disunion, that they must not be tired nor
fightened, for the Abolitionists would come year after year and ask
it, and we should gain it in the end. (Loud cheers.) And his reason
was, that they had gained all they had ever asked for, except Disunion and equal schools. He should only have to make one exception now. It is a fate! The moment a colored man and an Abolitionist sign a petition, it is fated - it will be granted in the end.
They might -just as well say -these proud legislators, up above the
reach of the tide-with the coon, "Is this Capt. John Scott?for if it is, I will come down, " - because they will have to come
down in the end! (Laughter and applause.) The next time he met
them, he should report progress, and say he attended this meeting,
which was another proof he was right. (Cheers.)
SPEECII OF WM. LLOYD GARRISON.
Mr. GARRISON was enthusiastically applauded as he took the platform. He said that, having just returned from a long journey, and
from unremitted public labors during the past week, he found himself completely jaded out, in body and mind; but he had promised
to be there that evening, and he had gladly come to redeem his
pledge.
In the first place, he desired to report progress, as it respected the
glorious cause of Anti-Slavery. He had just attended the annual
meeting of the Pennsylvania A. S. Society, in the city of Philadelphia. The meetings were characterised by great unity of spirit,
and entire order on the part of all who attended, though the most</P><P><PB ID="p00180018" N="18"> 
18
radical doctrines that could possibly be uttered were proclaimed and
enforced.  It was scarcely nine years since "Pennsylvania Hall,"
dedicated to Liberty, Justice and Humanity, was consumed to ashes
by the torch of pro-slavery incendiaries, merely because the Abolitionists were at that time advocating only the abstract doctrine of
immediate emancipation. Yet now, with their doors thrown wide
open, and with Southern slaveholders and medical students present,
they had been able to rebuke the pro-slavery religion of the land,
to repudiate the Constitution, and to demand the immediate dissolution of the Union; and not in any case was the slightest manifestation of hostility or dissent apparent. (Applause.) This was indicative of a great change in public sentiment in that quarter.
Judge Kane found, in their meetings, and in the city, "none so
poor to do him reverence," and the strongest denunciations of his
conduct, in the case of Passmore Williamson, elicited the warmest
approval. He had heard an anecdote which illustrated how the
young ideas were learning to shoot, in regard to that infamous
Judge.  A little boy was catechised after this sort: -"  Vho was
the first man?"  "Adam," was the reply.  "Who was the first
woman?"  "Eve."  "And who was the first murderer?"  "Judge
Kane!" (Laughter and applause.)
After what had been said by way of deserved eulogy upon his
friend Mr. Nell, and upon the subject of equal school rights, nothing further was needed at his hands, except most heartily to endorse it all.  He had been familiar with the history of Mr. Nell from
an early period in the Anti-Slavery movement; and he had ever
found him true to principle and duty. Their friend was a very
modest and diffident man; and this would restrain him (Mr. G.)
from saying in his presence, by way of panegyric, all that he might
desire to express in his absence.  They  were now celebrating a victory of far-reaching importance, achieved in a good degree through
Mr. N.'s indefatigable efforts, and tendering to him their warmest
thanks, and also a valuable token of their regard. Such an hour
was always a trying one to an unselfish spirit, because it is much
easier to stand up under the rebuffs of open enemies, than it is to
receive the plaudits of generous friends.
Mr. Garrison said that he rejoiced that the prejudice against
color was dying out, as a result of the Anti-Slavery struggle.  The
victory they had achieved went to prove what the Abolitionists had
so often affirmed, that the color of the skin has nothing at all to do</P><P><PB ID="p00190019" N="19"> 
with this prejudice, except, for the time being, to identify the victim
to be hated and proscribed. The moment it was bravely coped
with, and the struggle became successful, nobody dreamed of talking about the impossibility of whites and blacks mingling fraternally together.  When George Thompson, of England, was in this
country, he used to tell an anecdote, illustrating this matter of prejudice.  While travelling one day in New Hampshire, he met, in a
stage-coach, Hon. Salma Hale, who was one of the Commissioners
appointed to determine the boundaries between New Hampshire and
Maine. He said that, while engaged in this duty, Mr. Hale and his
companion had penetrated far into the wilderness, entirely away
from all habitations.  At length, however, they came to a solitary
hut, in which they found a lone woman, her husband being absent
in quest of game. As they were both very hungry, they asked the
woman if she could give them something to eat. She replied that
she could give them some bear's meat. Mr. Hale's companion had
a " prejudice" against bear's meat, so he asked her if she could not
give them something else.  "Well," said she, "I have got some
mince pies."  " That will do," said the gentleman; " I am excessively fond of mince pies." So the woman brought on the pies, and
the stranger was soon eating voraciously, eulogizing the pies in the
most emphatic strain. At length, the woman, thinking he must be
speaking in irony, said, apologetically, "What can you expect of a
poor woman out here in the woods, with nothing to make pies of
but bear's meat?"  "Wrhat!" exclaimed the gentleman, "do you
mean to say that these pies were made of bear's meat!"  "Certainly," said the woman.  "Well, then," said he, "I don't care if I take
that other remaining piece." (Laughter and applause.) So, the
whites will, by and by, be calling for more colored children, instead
of excluding them from our common schools, so ashamed will they
be of their ridiculous prejudices. This prejudice is not in nature,it does not belong to the human race, - and therefore it ought to be
put away, at once and for ever.
The victories of the colored people and their friends, over the enemies of impartial freedom, had been numerous and signal; but
they had been achieved by rare fidelity and unfaltering perseverance, and by seemingly the feeblest instrumentalities. No great
reform was ever projected or early espoused by any powerful organization at the outset. It begins in the heart of a solitary individual;
humble men and humble women, unknown to the community,
19</P><P><PB ID="p00200020" N="20"> 
20
without means, without power, without station, but perceiving the
thing that ought to be done, loving the right above all things, and
having faith in the triumph of what is just and true, engage in the
work, and by and by, the little leaven leavens the whole lump; and
this is the way the world is to be redeemed. We have, said Mr.
Garrison, every thing to encourage us in a firm adherence to principle.  We have never made an issue, as it regards the cause in
which we are engaged, in which we have not at last succeeded. It
is impossible to do a right act, and be defeated. The enemy may
seem to triumph, but it is only a seeming; the truth, in the end,
will get the victory.
Among our triumphs, the abolition of all complexional distinctions in the schools of Boston - an event we are here to commemorate- is particularly encouraging. The struggle has been a long
and severe one with the pride, the wealth, the aristocratic refinement of the city; but these have been vanquished, and all parties
are now reconciled to the change as beneficial, right and proper.
And this is but the beginning of the end -the prophecy of the
ultimate extinction of complexional caste throughout the land, and
of the reign of peace and liberty universally. To our vigilant and
untiring friend, Mr. Nell, a large share of the credit belongs for this
great victory; and this public recognition of his efforts is as creditable to our colored fellow-citizens as it is worthily his due.
In conclusion, Mr. Garrison expressed his gratification at seeing
the Chairman (Mr. Hilton) present, who, he said, had never been
found wanting in intelligent discrimination as to the best course to
be pursued in the Anti-Slavery movement, and who had ever been
ready to do his utmost in behalf of the cause, without compromise
or fear. God grant, (said Mr. G.,) that you, my old and cherished
friend and supporter, may live to see, with your own eyes, the day
of jubilee!  And may we all be permitted to join in that glorious
celebration! Be assured, we will have freedom yet; we will have
free soil and free institutions yet. There is no going back- not a
hair's breadth; but " Onward!" is our motto.  We will do to the
slaveholders, in regard to our Republic, what Jesus did to the
money-changers in the temple: we will take the scourge of truth,
and drive them out, and there shall not be a tyrant left on our soil.
(Loud cheers.)</P><P><PB ID="p00210021" N="21">

SPEECH OF CHARLES LENOX REMOND.
Mr. REMOND (who, on coming forward, was warmly applauded)
said that he had come up from Salem for the purpose of attending
that meeting, and he hoped this fact would be accepted as a slight
indication of the interest he felt in the Anti-Slavery cause, and as a
testimony that he shared in the feelings which had called that large
assembly together. To effect this reform in the matter of school
rights had required a great deal of self-sacrifice and the performance
of much drudgery, and he was glad that his friend Nell had been
called here to receive these testimonials at the hands of his colored
friends for the work he had performed.
He thanked God for this occasion, and took courage. He regard ed it as one indication that the colored people were beginning to
understand the necessity of adhesiveness and consistency-qualities
in which, he thought, they had hitherto been lamentably deficient.
The day that should witness union among the colored people would
witness strength among them, and a general victory, not only over
prejudice, but over slavery. (Loud cheers.)
But while they had come up there to congratulate each other on
the victory they had achieved, they should be careful to make it
understood that they were not yet satisfied with the state of things
in Massachusetts. While he admitted, with Mr. Phillips, that this
victory afforded a basis for further efforts, he should continue to feel
uneasy in his native State while there was a single act of proscription on the part of the white people against the colored people.
They must bear in mind that they were yet excluded from the jury
box; and he hoped that the colored people of Boston and of the
State would commence a new agitation, and not allow it to cease
until colored men are seated in the jury box,- at least, on every
occasion when a colored man is to be tried. (Prolonged cheering.)
In England, when a foreigner was put on trial in a court of justice,
one half of the jury were composed of foreigners. They ought to
insist here, that when a colored man was tried, one half of the jury
should also be colored.
There were certain things which, Mr. Remond said, he wanted
the colored people to do, whether the whites desired it or not. They
had been accustomed te refer to the judgment of their white friends,
but there were certain questions upon which the judgment of the</P><P><PB ID="p00220022" N="22"> 
22
colored man was the best, because the peculiarity of his position
better fitted him to understand them.
Mr. R. said he hoped that when they left that house, they would
go away with a firm resolution, that wherever there was a difficult
duty to be performed in the Anti-Slavery cause, they would assist
in its performance, as well as rejoice in the hour of triumph. And
when they should do this, they would strengthen the hands and
hearts of their white friends. He had no sympathy with the plea
that was now made by some, that the colored people should take
their cause into their own hands. He held that the Anti-Slavery
cause was as much the cause of the white man as of the colored
man, for the moment a white man became thoroughly identified
with the cause, he was subjected to the same odium and the same
insults as the colored man. He trusted he should live to see the
day when the last shackle should fall from the last slave in this
country; but he should not see it until greater sacrifices were
made by the colored people,- until they should learn to value that
which was valuable. A great work was yet before them, and they
should resolve to do their duty; and if the white man attempted
to brow-beat them, let them stand up before him; and if he was
determined to drive rough-shod over them and their rights, let
them, like the Athenian youth, throw themselves under the wheels
of his chariot, resolved rather to die in the spirit of freemen, than
live slaves. (Loud applause.)
Some twenty years' experience in the Anti-Slavery cause had
taught him one thing - to try and be satisfied with his native coun try, believing that truth, right and liberty will yet prevail. It
would be a burning shame, after what the colored people have suf fered in this country, if they should turn their backs upon it. They
ought rather to remain here, to demand their rights, and testify to
all the world that, with the recognition of those rights, they dare do
all that other men dare do. There was a time when he took a
pride in the patriotism of colored men in the early history of this
country; but he thought now that they made a mistake in fighting
for the country at that time, and he thought that, if there should
be a war now, it would be a mistake for the colored people to take
part in it, except on condition that all their rights were granted to
them.
Mr. R. said he longed to see the day when it would no longer be
possible for any man or woman to point to pro-slavery colored</P><P><PB ID="p00230023" N="23"> 
23
churches, and to the spirit of colored women who send their children to pro-slavery schools, as evidences of inconsistency on their
part.  Chen these things could no longer be said of the people of
color, a great work would be done for the overthrow of American
slavery. No pro-slavery Committee or anti-slavery Committee
would then extend an invitation to slaveholders to address a respectable audience in the city of Boston. He wanted it understood that
the colored people regarded such things as insults to them, whatever
the motive might be. He wanted Anti-Slavery to become so radical
throughout the State, that if the slaveholder came here, he should
not be invited to address public audiences, or feasted and toasted in
private, but should be obliged to sneak through the community, lest
it should be known that he was a slaveholder. (Prolonged cheering.) When this should be the case, he should feel that they were
approaching that day which was to witness the deliverance of the
slave from his chains.
In making these remarks, Mr. Remond said he did so in no invidious spirit towards any Committee. He wanted the slaveholder
made disreputable in the community where colored people lived;
and it was in their power so to act, that any Committee would consider it an insult to their intelligence and patriotism to invite the
slaveholder into their midst.
In conclusion, Mr. Remond said - " Mr. President, the colored
people in Boston must resolve to take more anti-slavery newspapers;
they must resolve to contribute more dollars; they must resolve to
honor those who devote themselves to their cause; they must resolve to make common cause with those who are laboring in their
behalf, and then the work will be comparatively light, and we shall
accomplish it the sooner. I look over England, France, Germany,
Hungary, Poland, and I see those who consider themselves downtrodden, in each and all of those countries, taking advantage of the
present agitation on the great question of liberty or slavery, and
resolving to do more than before to secure their emancipation.
Let the colored people of this country be but united under a common principle of action, and resolved zealously to labor in its behalf,
and all will yet be well. (Loud applause.)
Mr. GAnRISON said he was gratified and thankful that their friend
Remond, while recognising a victory that had been won, had not
forgotten the work that yet remained to be done. They ought now</P><P><PB ID="p00240024" N="24"> 
24
to join heart and hand in an appeal to the Legislature to demand
that all laws in the Southern States which forbid colored seamen
from the North going to the South shall be repealed, and in a way
that shall show they are in earnest. The South should be made to
understand, that if this is not possible for Massachusetts within the
TJnion, then she will make it possible without the Union. (Great applause.)
The following note from Rev. TiEODORE PARKER was then read
by one of the Secretaries: -
BOSTON, Dec. 17, 1855.
WM. C. NELL, ESQ.:
DEAR SIR,-I regret exceedingly that an engagement to lecture
at Framingham will deprive me of the pleasure I had anticipated,
in attending the meeting of your countrymen and friends, this evening. I hoped to be with them and you on so joyous an occasion;
but as it is impossible, allow me to say, that I think none of your
many friends has a higher opinion of your faithful, continuous and
modest services to your townsmen and your race, than
Yours, truly,       THEODORE  PARKER.
The befiediction was then pronounced by Rev. L. A. GRIMEs, and
the exercises terminated.
' We learn that the morning after the meeting, Mr. NELL received from Mrs. H. B. STOwE an elegant copy of the illustrated
edition of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," with the following note:
"i Mrs. Stowe desires to present to Mr. Nell this small addition to
the tribute of last evening, regretting that an unfortunate accident
prevented its being presented on that occasion.
4 May those benefits of education which Mr. Nell has helped to
secure for his people bring forth an abundant harvest!
" BOsTON, Dec. 18, 1855."
