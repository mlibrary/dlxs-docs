REPORT OF COMMITTEE
ON
COURSES OF STUDY
FOR THE
ILLINOIS INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY.
PUBLISHED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.
Inasmuch as some time must necessarily elapse before the University
can be properly equipped and prepared for opening, the committee
present now, only the outlines and some of the general features of a
plan of organization, hoping to be permitted, by fuller consultation
with each other, and with eminent educators in other States, who are
engaged in organizing similar institutions, to ripen their plans more
fully before presenting them in detail.  In laying the foundations of
an institution which is to last through coming ages, and to affect all
future generations, we have need to plan wisely.  We must not expose
ourselves, needlessly, to the inconveniences of changes, nor to suspicions of caprice.
THE GENERAL AIMS OF THE UNIVIRSITY.
The aims of any institution necessarily control its organization. It
should be fitted to its uses. The great general aims of the University
are defined by the statutes under which it is established. Though not
strictly confined by law to the objects proposed in the congressional
grant, we are yet bound to meet those objects fully and fairly.  According to the language of the grant, "the leading object shall be, without
excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including militar
tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture
and the mechanic arts, in order to promote the liberal and practical
education of the industrial classes, in the several pursuits and profes-s,
sions in life."

Or, changing the order of statement, the chief aim of the University
is, " the liberal and tpractical educatdon of the industrial classes, in the
several pursuits and professions in life;" and in order to this end, the
University is "to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, without excluding other scientific and
classical studies, and including military tactics."  The military tactics
are required, and the scientific and classical studies are permitted. Such
at least is the common construction of these clauses, though the language may not unreasonably be understood to imply that the latter
studies shall not be excluded from the course.
The State law evidently aims to carry out the intention of the congressional grant, and gives the trustees power " to appoint such professors and instructors, and establish and provide for the management of
such model farms, model art and other departments, as may be required to teach, ill the most thorough manner, such branches of learning as
are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, and military tactics,
without excluding other scientific and classical studies."  This slight
change of the order of the language of the congressional enactment,
gives additional emphasis to tilhe opinion that it was intended to prohibit the exclusion of other scientific and classical studies.  Under any
construction, the Legislature evidently intended to insist-as the law
of Congress insists-on the industrial and militarv education, yet explicitly allowing the trustees to enlarge the scope of studies as they
may see fit.
A clearer insight into the real intention of the congressional grant
may be gained if we call to inind thatthe Colleges, existing at the time
of the passage of the act mlaking this grant, were adapted only to fit
men for the so-called " learned professions,"' and that the influence of
these colleges tended to withdraw their students from the pursuits of
industry. Congress therefore proposed to create a new class of colleges, which should train men for industrial pursuits, and help to turn
some portion of the great currents of educated life into the channels of
industry.  They aimed to link learning more closely to labor, and to
bring the light of science more fiully to the aid of the productive arts.
Any other interpretation of the design of Congress than this would
involve an absurdity.
The Industrial College was not an expression of congressional con demnation of the ordinary college, or opposition to it. A grant of a
township of land in each new  State had  already pr(ovided for State
Universities of the common sort.  And besides these, rich and powerful seats of learning were every where fitting men for the great public
fields of Law, Medicine and Theology.  Congress only sought to extend
still wider the benefits of science and liberal culture.'Whey wished to
establish other seats of learning, equally great and equally powerful,
which should send scholars of high scientific attainments and broad
and liberal culture, to the farms and workshops of the country.
And finally, as it was not the object of the Industrial Colleges to
educate simply the sons of farmers and mechanics, so it was not their
design to teach the mere manual arts of agriculture and manufacture.
Tihe college course can not replace the apprenticeship in the shop or on
the farm; and if it could, a hundred such universities as this could
I</P><P><PB ID="p00050005" N="5"> 
6
not train to their various trades the fiuture farmers and mechanics of
this State. Some practice should, if possible, accompany the scientific
study of the several arts, but the aim of this practice must be to insure
the thorough comprehension of the principles involved. To teach the
millions their trades, however desirable, is beyond  our power.  To so
teach the few who will come and patiently complete their course, that
they shall be thorough masters of practical science, and able in their
turn to teach others, this is the worthy and attainable end of the
University.
The committee profoundly appreciate and commend the far-reaching
wisdom and beneficence of these aims of the congressional grant, and
would seek to carry them out to the very letter. They have discussed
thus fully the intent of the congressional enactment, in order to brush
aside the false impressions which mnay have gained currency, and to
bring out into clearer relief this grand idea of the Industrial IUniversity,
as it lies involved in both State and national statutes-a true University
organized in the interest of the industrial, rather than of the professional pursuits, and differing from other Universities in that its departments are technological rather than professional-schools of Agriculture and Art, rather than schools of Medicine and Law.  Its central
educational courses, while equally broad and liberal, are to be selected
to fit men for the study and mastery of the great branches of industry,
rather than to serve as introductions to the study of law, medicine, or
thieology.
This broad idea of the Industrial University proceeds upon the two
fundamental assumptions: First, that tihe agricultural and mechanical
arts are the peers of any others in their dignity, importance and scientific scope: and, Second, that the thorough mastery of these arts, and
of the sciences applicable to theirm, requires an education different in
kind, but as systematie and complete as that required for the comprehlension of the learned professions.  It thus avoids the folly of offering
as leaders of progress in the splendid industries of the nineteenth century, men of meager attainments and stinted culture, and steers clear
also of that other and absurder fblly of supposing that mere common
school boys, without any thorough discipline, can successfully master
and apply the complicated sciences which enter into and explain the
manifold processes of modern agriculture and mechanic art.
Nor is it forgotten that man is something more than the artisan, and
that manhood  has duties and interests higher and grander than those
of the workshop and the farm.  Education must fit for society and citizenship, as well as for science and industry. The educated agriculturist and mechanic will not unfrequently be called to serve in Senate
chambers and gubernatorial chairs, and will need an education broader
and better than the simple knowledge of his art.
The State has need every where, but especially in the center and at
the head of the great industries on which, as on corner stones, rest
down her material progress and power, of broad-breasted, wise-hearted,
clear-thinking men-men of rich, deep culture, and sound education.
And besides all this, it should be reflected that half the public value
of a body of educated and scientific agriculturists and mechanicians</P><P><PB
ID="p00060006" N="6"> 
6
will be lost, if they lack the literary culture which will enable them to
communicate, through the press, or by public speech, their knowledge
and discoveries; or if they are wanting in that thorough discipline
which will make them active and competent investigators and inventors,
long after their school days are over.
Nor  would we  forget, nor attempt  by a one-sided education  to
restrain, that free movement and versatility of American life and
genius which leads so many of our more eminent citizens to the successive mastery of several vocations. Let us educate for life, as well
as for art, leaving genius free to follow its natural attractions, and lending to talent a culture fitting it for all the emergencies of public or
private duty. If some of our graduates shall quit, for a time, the
harvest field for the forum, or prefer medicine to mechanic art, we shall
hope they will demonstrate that, even in professional life, the education
we give is neither inferior nor inadequate. And in riper years they
will return to their first love, and bring their gathered wealth and
honors to lay them in the lap of the agriculture and art we have taught
them. Let the State open wide, then, this Pierian fount of learning.
Let her bid freely all her sons to the full and unfailing flow: those
whose thirst or whose needs are little, to what they require; those
whose thirst and whose capacities are large, to drink their fill. Let
the university be made worthy the great state whose name it bears;
worthy the grand and splendid industries it seeks to promote; and
worthy of the great century in which we live.
DEPARTMENTS AND COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
Having thus defined the general idea and aims of the University,
the Committee suggest the following enumeration of departments,
with the courses of instruction in each:
1.  The Agriczultural I)epartment-Embracing:
1. The course in Agriculture proper.
2. The course in Horticulture and Landscape Gardening.
II   The Polytechnice Depajrtinent-Embracinig:
1. The course in Mechanical Science and Art.
2.  The course in Civil Engineering.
3.  The course in Mining and Metallurgy.
4. The course in Architecture and Fine Arts.
III   The $filitary Departrnent-Embracing:
1. The course in Military Engineering.
2. The course in Military Tactics.
IV.  The Departmnent of Chenmistry and Neatural Science.
V. Y7te Department of Trade and Commerce.
VL   Th7e L)epartmnient of General Science and Literature-Embracing:
1. The course in Mathematics.
2. The course in Natural History, Chemistry, etc.
3. The course in English Language and Literature.
4. The course in Modern Languages and Literature.
5. The course in Ancient Languages and Literature.
6. The course in History and Social Science.
7. The course in Philosophy, Intellectual and Moral.</P><P><PB
ID="p00070007" N="7"> 
7
It may not be found feasible to develop all these departments at the
outset, but ultimately even others may be added to those here enumerated.
The following brief exposition of some of the principal courses will
exhibit their general scope:
1.  The course in agriculture proper may embrace the study of
common tillage, arboriculture, fruit growing, cattle and sheep husbandry,
veterinary art, agricultural chemistry, and rural engineering and architecturie.
Its aim will be to give a practical knowledge of the various kinds of
soils, their composition and improvement, by chemical or by mechanical treatment; the several classes of crops, with the preparation of
the soil, seeding, cultivation and harvesting of each; the rotation
of crops, and preparation and use of fertilizers; vegetable anatomy
and physiology, with the classification, values, and laws of growth
and culture of the cereals, grasses, and other useful plants, together
with general botany; friiuit-growing and the several modes of propagation, and the production of new varieties; arboriculture, with the
nature and value of the various species of ornamental,  shade  and
forest trees, the propagation, growth and care of forests, their importance and value in a prairie country, in their effects upon climate, vegetation and health; animal anatomy and physiology, with a study of
the breeds of domestic animals, and their values for the dairy, for fattening, for draught, and for wool or other products, and of the principles of stock-breeding; veterinary art, with the laws of feeding, care and
training of the domestic animals; the apiary and poultry yard; agricultural chemistry, applied to the analysis of soils, fertilizers and food,
etc.; entomnology, especially including the useful insects, and those
injurious to animal life; meteorology and climatology; rural architecture and engineering, embracing the planning of farm buildings, and
the laying out, draining and fencing of farms; political economy, the
laws of production, consumption and markets; real estate jurisprudence, the laws regulating the tenures and transfers of land, and the
laws relating to rural affairs; the history of agriculture, and general
views of the husbandry of foreign countries. To these studies should
be added, either to prepare for the foregoing, or as necessary to complete education, courses in matheinatics, language and literature, mental and mnoral philosophy, logic, history and science of government.
The instruction should be partly by text-books, and partly by lectures, enforced by observation and practice in the laboratory, and the
various departments of the experimental farm.
2. The course of instruction in horticulture may comprehend most
of the studies already described under the course in agriculture, omitting stock-breeding and veterinary art, and adding to the fruit-growing,
the culture of the small fruits and culinary vegetables, and the culture
of flowers; the construction and management of the hot-bed, the greenhouse, the grapery, the seed-plot and the nursery; landscape gardening, the laying out and ornamentation of public and private pleasure
grounds, parks, cemeteries, etc. The methods of instruction should be
like those in the department of agriculture.</P><P><PB ID="p00080008" N="8">

3. The courses in mechanics, civil engineering and mining belong
properly to the polytechnic school.  All the fundamental sciences
involved in them being taught at the University, these courses may
also be developed there.  The committee defer the delineation of a
course of instruction in this department till the question of the extent
of its means of development is settled.
4. Military tactics being specifically required by the act of Congress,
the development of this department to such an extent as may be found
practicable, should be undertaken at the outset. While the effect of
this department will be to scatter through the state a body of men so
far advanced in military art that, in case of war, they will furnish skillful officers, ready to drill and lead the volunteer forces of the country,
it is the opinion of many experienced educators that the introduction
of the military drill and discipline is of positive value for their educating influence.  They will materially assist in the government of the
institution, and tend to~form those habits of order and punctuality, for
the want of which so many educated men fail of usefulness and success.
It is strongly recommended by eminent military officers, that some
simple and tasteful uniform be prescribed for all the students, as the
law contemplates and provides; that the organization partake somnewhat the military form, and that a daily drill be had in military tactics.  The uniform would not be more expensive than ordinary clothing, and its use would repress extravagances in dress, and promote a
feeling of democratic equality among the whole body of students. It
will help also to stimulate the virtues of personal neatness and manly
courtesy of demeanor.
By frequent rotations in office, and by making those eligible to office
who merit it by proficiency in drill and by good soldierly conduct, a
sufficient stimulus would be gained to insure attention, and both the
faculties of obedience and command would be developed. Students of
the first year might be required to serve in the ranks and as non-commissioned officers, the higher officers being selected from the advanced
classes. Some new drill might also be introduced for each advanced
class, and thus the interest be sustained.
Besides the field exercises, some elementary text books should be
used, and the students be required to read for recitations or for exarminations on the general principles of military science.
It is hoped by the friends of military education that provision will
soon be made by congress for the detail of competent officers of the
army to act as professors of military science in the colleges introducing
it, and that in this way the university may be provided with instructors
in this department.
5. The course in chemistry amd natural science will embrace the
study of analytical and practical chemistry, the analysis of soils, ores,
minerals and organic bodies, and the applications of chemistry in agriculture and the arts of dyeing and bleaching, and the manufacture of
sugar, salt, glass, etc. It will embrace also the more extended and
practical study of mineralogy, geology, and natural history in general,
with the arts of collecting and preserving specimens, and of arranging
cabinets and conducting geological surveys.</P><P><PB ID="p00090009" N="9">

6 The instruction in the departrnent of trade and commerce will hlave
for its aim to give students a knowledge of the principles of business, and
of the customs and laws of trade-the collection, transportation, exchange and distribution of the valuable products of nature and art.  Such
knowledge will be eminently valuable to the educeated farmer, and is
of vital necessity to those who are to be employed in the great coimmercial branches of industry.  Thle crowded rooms of the comrniercial
schools, meagre and unscientific as the instruction of tlhese schools
often is, prove conclusively the felt need of such a department of instruction, and the university would be incomplete in its industrial
courses if it should leave this important form of human industry unprovided for.
The studies in this department, in addition to such literary studies
as are necessary for the requisite discipline and  culture, and such
knowledge of natural sciences as may be needful to an understandirng
of the origin, nature, quality and cost of the commodities, crude and
manufactured, known to commerce, should embrace also political ecollomyi, the Jaws of production, exchange and consumption as they affect
markets; the theories of banking, insurance, and foreign and domestic
exchange; the laws governing importation and exportation, the several classes of imposts, duties, etc, and the theories connected therewith;
commercial geography, with the staple commodities of the different
regions and nations, their commnercial condition, usages and markets;
book-keeping in its several forms, and commercial customs, papers and
correspondence; and finally, commercial law  and the history of commerce with its growthls and variations.  Such knowledge, while it
would make intelligent business men, farmers, merchants and mannfacturers, and managers of the great business enterprises of the nation,
would help to prevent those ruinous speculations and disastrous failures
which spring as often from a pitiable ignorance of the great fundameintal laws of trade, as from a willful violation of them.
DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SCIENCE AND LITERATURE.
The several courses in this department make up the general educational or college course.  Their main aim is to furnish sutch a liberal
education as may best fit students either for the niastery of the special
courses in the arts, or f)r the general duties of' life.  The final composition and adjustment of this central course will demand the most careful consideration. The conflicting views which prevail as to relative
values of different branches of learning, and the consequent disposition
to scout some as useless, and to magnify others as of overshadowing
importance, make it requisite for us to recur briefly to some fundamental principles which ought to control our selection.
The knowledges considered as instruments of culture or education,
may be broadly grouped into four grand divisions, as follows:
1. Natural sciences, or sciences of observation and experiment.
2. Mathematics, or the science of imagination and calculation.
3. Linguistic and philological sciences, or the sciences of formal expression.</P><P><PB
ID="p00100010" N="10"> 
10
4. Philosophical and speculative sciences, or the sciences of consciousness and reflection.
Each firm of knowledge affects culture by two separate methods.
First, by the kind and extent of the exercise its study affords the mind,
and secondly, by the exciting and stimulating effect of its proper ideas.
Some studies are chiefly valuable for the former, and others for the
latter use.
The natural sciences, or sciences of nature, embracing natural history, chemnistry, natural philosophy, geology, physical geography and
uranography, especially exercise and cultivate the powers of observation, classification and inductive reasoning.
The mathematical studies, embracing both pure and applied mathematics, exercise and develop the capacity to form and combine abstract
conceptions, and cultivate the deductive reason. They also promote
habits of mental concentration and continuity of thought.
Linguistic studies educate the discriminative judgment, and develop
the power both of the expression and reception of thought. They train
also the faculty of discursive reasoning, and help to give to the mental
action a precision and clearness not otherwise to be gained.
The philosophical and speculative sciences, embracing mental and
moral philosophy, and historical and social science, address themselves
to minds already well matured, and powerfully exercise the reflective
faculties.  They especially develop the habit of looking for the fundamental and essential, in facts and things; of investigating the real
nature and causes of social and vital phenomena, and of that reasoning
from the contingent and the probable, which goes among us by the
name of "common sense."
If we turn now to note the other educational force found in these several classes of knowledge-the stimulating power of their proper ideaswe shall find an equal diversity in the kind and degree of their infinen(:e; the philosophical studies being to the majority of mature minds,
the most stimulating, and the mnateinatical, the least.
Natural science gives us a knowledge of physical facts and pheno.
mena, and of the great forces and laws of nature underlying these.
This knowledge has in all ages stimulated the most eager curiosity and
awakened the spirit of inquiry into physical causes. It has also excited
the mnost wild and extravagant speculations.
The mathemiatics afford us only the knowledge of the abstract relations
of quantity and number, and of certain formulas of analysis. It is by
its problems that this science excites the mental activities. Its ideas
lie mostly inert in the mind, except when wanted as instruments of calculation.
Languag,e, like mathematics, is mainly concerned with relations; but
it is with the relations of ideas and thoughts in all departments of
knowledge.  The study of language is the study of the connections, as
well as of the expression, of thought. Grammar, as J. Stuart Mill has
justly observed, is "incipient logic." But language is the instrument
and the store-house, as well as the veh?icle of thought.  It is full of history, philosophy, science and poetry. It powerfully stimulates the
thinking processes by the facilities it affords for the manufacture as
well as the commerce of thought.</P><P><PB ID="p00110011" N="11"> 
11
But no knowledge so profoundly stirs and stimulates the human mind
as the great questions with which philosophy and history have to do.
These questions come down to us from those great central heights of
truth, unattainable it may be in their heaven piercing summits, but
still irresistibly attracting all great thinkers, and calling for the mightiest efforts of the human intelligence in the struggle to master their
mysterious and still unsolved problems.
it seems too obvious to need further argument that a true educational
course must include these four classes of studies, and that if we would
send forth a body of thoroughly educated agriculturists, to stand as the
peers of the educated men found in other professions, we must give
our students the benefits of a course with its full proportionate measure
of each of these elements. "'It is an ancient and universal observation," said that great thinker and teacher, Sir William HIamilton, "It
is an ancient and universal observation, that different studies cultivate
the mind to a different development; and as tile end of a liberal education is the general and harmonious evolution of its faculties and capacities in their relative subordination, the folly has accordingly been
long and generally denounced which would attempt to accomplish this
result, by the partial application of certain partial studies." Testimony
could be multiplied on this point from the world's greatest thinkers.
It is not necessary that all the branches in each of these great classes
of studies be included in the course. Provided that each class is represented in something like its due proportion, we are at liberty to select
of two kindred studies of nearly equal disciplinary power, that one
which most conduces to the special uses we have in view. In making
up a course for the Industrial University, we may wisely and safely
depart from the common college curriculum; and, without losing any
of its real advantages, may gain much special assistance for our industrial courses.
STUDIES OF THE UNIVERSITY COURSE.
In Physical Sciences, the course should embrace botany, zoology,
mineralogy, chemistry, geology and physics, not in the stinted measure
and nearly. useless manner in which they are usually taught, but with
such extent and thoroughness as shall give students a practical comprehension and knowledge of each. The scientific farmer or mechanic
should be a good naturalist.
In Mathematics, besides algebra and geometry, the student of agriculture needs trigonometry and land surveying; while the mechanic and
civil engineer require also analytical geometry, mechanics and the calculus. These studies, therefore, should find place in this general course.
In language, the course should embrace a thorough study of our
own language, its rhetoric and literature.
Of Modern Languages, it should include the French and German,
taught with such thoroughness that the student may read them with
ease, and converse in them with somne facility. The scientific agriculturist ought to be able to avail himself of the fresh discoveries of the
French and German men of science. Hie is shut out fronm the best
scientific thinkers of the age, and from many of the best sources of</P><P><PB
ID="p00120012" N="12"> 
knowledge, if he can not read the languages of France and Germany.
And the prevalent use of these languages in our own country, among
large masses of our population, gives to their study  an additional
value.
The Latin language, both because it enters so largely into our own
and other modern languages, and because it is to such an extent the
latngutage of science, will demand a place in the course.  As an instrument of linguistic culture it greatly surpasses modern languages, and
its literature is of perennial value.  When well taught, no study more
riclilv rewards the student.  The Greek should be afforded, at least as
an optional study, to all who desire to pursue it. It will never lose its
value in the eyes of the highest grade of scholars.
MIental and Moral Pthilosophy, Logic, History, Political Ecomomny,
Civil Polity and Constitutional Law, will all properly enter into the
course as philosophical and speculative studies, and: because of their
hilgh practical values.
A  course, composed of these studies, reaching through  four years
will fully equal in its disciplinary power thie ordinary college course,
and be of much more value to the student of the industrial arts.
It seems alnmiost idle to say, we admit, many of these studies are not
necessary to the mere practical farmer.  Latin will not help a man to
hold a plow, nor will mental philosophy teach how to fatten hogs.  But
we reiterate, the Industrial University is not needed and was not founded for the common education of men, farmers or others.'" The liberal
and practical education" proposed by Congress will require all the
amplitude of study here described.
It is rnot insisted that all students shall take this general course,
thlough it is strongly recommended.   Students may  take up special
courses without stopping to complete this, just as they may take a medical or law course at any other University, without first graduating from
the college course.
The special c(ourses in Agriculture and the Arts will comprehend
many of the studies belonging to the general course, and they may be
so arranged that a diligent student, of good abilities, while pursuing
the regular University course, may also take up and carry forward one
of the special technical courses. The studies of the Universitv course
being the minimum of study required to entitle the student to regular
standing; it will be found that many students can perform successfully
more than this minimum.
By further arranging the special courses so as to connect them with
the last three years of the University course, and by bringing them,
as tar as practicable, into the fall and winter session, we may coinply with the provision of the law, and also allow students of Agriculture or Horticulture alone, to complete their special studies in a three
years' course.
OPTIONAL AND SELECT COURSES.
The opinion gathers currency that students of mature age and experience should be permitted to enter our universities and colleges and
select for themselves such studies as they may need, and as they are
12</P><P><PB ID="p00130013" N="13"> 
13
aqualified to pursue successfully with the regular classes in those studies.
It may sometimes also occur that persons will desire to enter the university simply to attend some course of lectures, or to attain an insight
into some agricultural or other industrial process,  as the  budding,
grafting or pruning of trees, the management of a grapery, etc. Such
students should be furnished with all the facilities consistent with the
good order of the institution.
QUALIFICATIONS FOR ADMISSION.
The question of the qualifications required for admission to the university is one demanding caretful consideration. These requiremnents
should not be so  high as to virtually exclude those who mnight successfully pursue the courses of study, nor so low as to admit those who are
unprepared to profit by a residence at the institution, and whose time
would be uselessly wasted in the attempt to grasp studies beyond their
comprehension.
The law prescribes that "no student shall be admitted to instruction in any of the departments of the University who shall not have
attained to the age of fifteen years, and who shall not previously undergo, a satisfactory examination in each of the branches ordinarily taught
in the common schools of the State." The committee understand this
lainguage, not as fixing definitely the qualifications for admission, but
only as determining their lowest limit. The trustees may require both
a maturer age and a higher grade of scholarship, whenever in their
estimation the interests of the State and of the University require it.
It would certainly be better if students never entered college under
eighteen years of age; but the average age of these applying for admission will doubtless be above this, without any special rule requiring
it.  Experience shows that students who enter college at a less age
than that here indicated, are often injured by being thrown so early
into the indiscriminate associations and powerful stimulation of college
life. The University is the place for men rather than for mere boys.
It seems requisite that two different sets of qualifications shall be
prescribed; the one for students who wish to pursue simply the studies
of.some select or partial course, and the other for candidates for the
regular University courses.
1. QUALIFICATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO SELECT COURSES.
Students may properly be admitted to take some select course, on
passing a thorough examination in the common school branches of
reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and grammar, and on evidence
of sufficient maturity and intelligence to pursue successfully the studies
selected by them.
2. ADMISSION TO REGULAR UNIVERSITY COURSES.
While the committee would wish to open the University as widely
as possible to the youth of the State, they can not forget that its real
utility will depend on establishing and maintaining a high standard of
scholarship. As it can not legally do common school work, so neither</P><P><PB

14
ought it to undertake to do the work already provided for in the public
high schools. It would prove a most sorry blunder if in our too eager
desire to popularize the institution, and under pretence of bringing its
advantages within the easy reach of all, we should create, a gigantic
and expensive high school, and, haviing thus consumed our means,
should fail to make any University at all. It is absolutely essential,
if the University is to do the higher and scientific work required of it,
that it shall leave the preparatory work mainly, if not entirely, to the
public high schools and academies of the State; else it may fritter
away its funds and its teaching forces, on the mere elementary work
already sufficiently provided for, arid leave undone all the great work
which we ask at its hands for scientific agriculture and industrial
arts.
The reasonable construction of the statute is that while the University shall not comprehend the ordinary common school studies, it shall
so arrange its terms of admission that the public schools may be able
to meet them, and that there be left no unbridged chasm between the
body of the State school system and the University at its head.
In the better class of public schools there are now taught, not only
Grammar, Geography and Arithtetic, but also Algebra, Geometry,
Natural Philosophy, History of the United States, and Human Physiology, and in very many of them the Latin language.  All these may
properly be prescribed therefore as preparatory studies for the UIniversity. They are all so elementary in character as to come within
the easy comprehension of students under fifteen years of age; they
all need to be stu(lied as preparations for mastering the University
course; and they may all be successfully taught in public high schools.
In the Latin the quality of the scholarship attained, rather than the
quantity of the reading, may wisely be made the test, and the student
should be admitted who can construe readily any passage in Cicero's
Select Orations, or Virgil's Georgies and -neid.
The preparatory course above indicated differs from that ordinarily
prescribed for admission to colleges, in the omission of the Greek language, and in the extension of the requirements in mathematics and
other studies. It is believed that this variation will not only better
adapt the preparation to the peculiar character of the University, but
will adjust the University much more nearly to the ordinary course of
studies now generally taught in our public high schools.'These schools
universally teach Geometry and Algebra; but only in a few cases
teach Greek to any great extent.  The grade of scholarship required
for admission will thus be made as high as that required at other Universities, though made up of different elements.  To make the work of
the Industrial University thorough and complete, demands that the
preparation for it shall be also full and sufficient.
The argument for an elevated standard of qualifications for admission
gains great force from the fact, that until the student has made as much
progress as this preparatory course requires, he has not usually formed
his purpose and tested his strength and ability to pursue a course of
liberal or scientific study. The history of preparatory schools is full of
proof that many of those who set out for a college course stop short of
the college doors. Science, like scripture, has its "stony ground" hear</P><P><PB

ers, who at first receive the word with joy, but who, when the hot sun
of hard study is up, wither away. If our doors must be held open to
every half-taught youth who is seized with a sudden ambition to "go to
the University," our halls will be flooded annually with fresh hosts of
mere tyros, who will stay only long enough to manifest their unfitness
for the place, and then go forth to shame the institution whose students
they will claim to have been; thus ruining its reputation, after helping
to destroy or impair its usefulness.
Among this host of short-lived "students of the Industrial JUniversity" the state will look in vain for that long line of graduates-the ripe
and scholarly leaders in her agriculture and her great industries-which
she has hoped to see proceed annually from the university halls.
The committee are confident that no person who properly considers
the amount of mnore important work which the university has to accotmplish. will wish to see its forces diverted to the teaching of these elementary branches which the high schools may properly claim as their
own ground; and certainly no one who desires the success of the university, as a great scientific and industrial college, will wish to see
students entering its classes with less preparation than is here prescribed.
It needs to be repeated that this does not forbid students of suitable
maturity and experience to come to the university to take a few select
studies, without passing an examination in Latin and the higher mathematics named.
HONORARY SCHOLARSHIPS.
The law for the organization of the university provides that "each
county in the state shall be entitled to one honorary scholarship in the
university, for the benefit of the descendants of soldiers and seamen
who served in the armies and navies of the United States during the
late rebellion; preference being given to the children of such soldiers
and seaman as are deceased or disabled; and the board of trustees may
from time to time add to the number of honorary scholarships whel), in
their judgment, such additions will not embarrass the finances of the
university; nor need these additions be confined to the descendants of
soldiers or-seamen.  Such scholarships to be filled by transfer from the
common schools of said county of such pupils as shall, upon public examination, to be conducted as the board of trustees of the university
mav determine, be decided to have attained the greatest proficiency in
the branches of learning usually taught in the common schools, and who
shall be of good moral character and not less than fifteen years of age."
These scholarships entitle the incumbents to free tuition for three years.
The committee recommend that the Regent, in connection with the
Superintendent of Public Instruction, prepare examination papers, and
transmit the same to the county superintendent of schools in each
county, who, with other examiners, appointed by the Regent and Superintendent, will see that the examinations are properly conducted, and
will return the papers, with the written answers of the several candidates and with such testimonials as they may present, to the Regent,
who shall determine on the papers and notify the successful candidates
of their appointment.</P><P><PB ID="p00160016" N="16"> 
16
A competitive examination, thus uniform in character and this fairly
conducted, can not but react with a most healthful stimulation upon the
public school interests of the state; and this stimulation will be increased by a publication of the names of the schools in which the successful candidates were prepared, and the teachers by whom they were
taught.  In case any counties shall neglect to send students on their
scholarships, the Regent may be authorized to award such scholarships,
for the year, to suitable candidates from other counties.
CHARGES FOR TUITION, AND OTHER EXPENSES.
The committee would rejoice if the condition of our ftinds and the
provisions of the law would permit the University to be made free to
all citizens of the State, and they cordially recommend that its tuition
be made thus free at the earliest practicable moment; and that from the
outset the charges be made as light as as consistent with justice to the
institution itself.
The charges ill American Colleges ranige from a few dollars per
annium  to several hundreds.  In Yale College the annual fees amount
to $85. Thie annual fees at Harvard are $133. At the Michigan University each student pays a matriculation fee of $10, and an annual fee
of $5. At the Michigan Agricultural College the tuition is free for
citizens of the State.  Students from other States pay $20 per annum.
All students pay a matriculation fee o' $5.  The proposed fees for the
Cornell University are $20 a year for tuition; matriculation fee $15.
The committee recommend that the academic year be divided into
two semi-annual sessions, as nearly equal as may be, and that the tuition and other fees for each session be fixed at the following rates:
For tuition to students from other States, $10 per term..................$20 per annum
For incidentals, care and warming of public rooms, etc., $5 per term.... 10 " "
For room rent, $6 per t e r m........................................... 12 " 
They recommend, also, that a matriculation fee of $10 be charged to
each student on first entering the institution. This fee is never charged
a second time, but once paid, entitles the student to all the privile.
ges of membership at any time thereafter.
Students on the "honorary scholarships" will pay the matriculation
fee and charges for room rent and incidentals, but will be charged nothing for tuition.
BOARDING DEPARTMENT.
The building is provided with the necessary rooms for a boarding
department.  It is believed that in a short timle we may wholly dispense with this department, even if it must be opened at the outset.
Suitable boarding houses will doubtless soon spring up in the neighborhlood, and the rooms in the University building may be appropriated
to more public and proper uses.
STUDENTS' ROOMS.
There are in the University buildings sixty-six rooms designed for
students' dormitories, each dormitory being calculated to accommodate
i</P><P><PB ID="p00170017" N="17"> 
two students.  These rooms are without furniture.  It is customary to
leave students to provide their own furniture, as they will ordinarily
take better care of their own property than they will of that belonging
to a public institution.
MIANUAL LABOR SYSTEM.
One of the most important and difficult questions concerning the
organization of the University is that of the introduction of the manual
labor system.  It is true that the attempt to connect manual labor with
schools has in many instances failed; but the nature and extent of this
failure have not been generally understood.  It has not failed because
the students were unwilling to worlk, nor because the work was injurious either to their health or culture. It has simply failed to pay. The
labor of students was found unprofitable.
The high success and utilitv of the labor system, as practiced at the
Michigan Agricultural College, has, in the minds of your colmmnittee,
fully demonstrated its feasibility and value; and they would heartily
recommend its adoption here, provided similar conditions can be
secured.  There, each student is required by law to work three hours
a day, unless excused on account of sickness. The professors accompany the students to the garden or field, and participate in and direct
the work, which is made to illustrate the principles taught in the lecture
rooms. Wages, according to the value of the work done, not exceeding
seven and a-half cents an hour, are allowed the student, and he is thus
enabled to pay a considerable part of the expense of his schooling by
his labor. Even there the work has never yet proved remunerative to
the institution, though it annually approaches nearer this result.
It should be added that the manual labor system, as practiced at the
above named institution, has been carefully inspected by gentlemen
sent from several of the eastern States, and has been warmly commended in their published reports, as eminently satisfactory and successful.
The chief advantages of the labor system are these:
1. It promotes the physical health and development of the student.
2.  It cultivates habits of industry, and, keeping the student inured to
muscular effort, renders his return to the farm, or other physical labor,
natural and easy.  This is a point of much importance, if we wish
successfully to turn the tides of educated life into the industrial
employments.
3.  When  made, as in the agricultural course, to bear upon the
studies pursued, it creates a practical interest in, and comprehension of;
those studies which cannot be obtained by mere abstract study.
4.  When pursued, as here recommended, in the society of intelligent class-mates and teachers, and lighted with a knowledge of the
reason of every process, it is not only pleasant, blt comes to be seen
as noble and dignified; and thus the sentiment of honor to labor is
deeply implanted in the mind.
5.  It aids the student to pay his own way, and  cultivates in him
the feeling of manly independence.
These considerations are so important that they incline us to recommend its introduction, even though it should fail to pay all the expenses
attending it. But, if proper care is taken not to establish too high a
-2
117</P><P><PB ID="p00180018" N="18"> 
rate of compensation, the Committee are not without liope that no loss
need re3ult, even if no profit is gained.
APPARATUS OF ILLUSTRATION AND INSTRUCTIOrN.
Each department in the University will require, besides the general
cabinets or collections, some means of illustration and instruction peculiar to itself: For general study of the natural sciences there will be
needed full and well classified collections of specimens in mineralogy
and geology, in botany and ill the various branches of zoology.
The departments of agriculture and horticulture will require in addition, cabinets of seeds, grasses, grains and fruits; models or drawings
of farming and garden implements, of farm buildings, and plans of
farms, gardens, celebrated parks, and landscape gardens, etc.; and specimens and drawings of various breeds of domestic animals.
The department of mechanics and civil engineering, will demand a
cabinet of models and drawings of machinery, architectural plans,
plans of roads, bridges and other structures, and specimens of building
materials, as the various woods, marbles, granites and more common
building stones.
The military department will require its specimens or drawings of
the various kinds of arms and military structures, together with plans
of celebrated battle-fields, sieges, encampments, etc.
The department of fine arts will require casts, photographs or engravings of the great master- pieces in art.  These may be obtained at
reasonable rates, and original drawings, paintings and sculptures will,
in due time be added. The healthful, refining and stimulating influence of such collections on the mninds of the young, must be seen to be
properly appreciated.
The common working apparatus of instruction must embrace a good
set of chemical and philosophical apparatus. The prominence due to
chemistry in such an institution as this, will demand, at the earliest
practicable day, a separate and suitable building for a chemical laboratory, such as exists at Harvard, Yale and Amherst, and at the Michigan
University.
The experimental farms, orchards and gardens, with the several
stock barns, yards, pens, etc.; the mechanic shops, tools and machinery;
the military arms and parade grounds; the engineer's tools, and the
model counting house, will furnish the fitting apparatus for teaching in
the several leading departments of special instruction.
As the collection of cabinets is a work of years, it is important that
it begin at once, and that applications for duplicate specimens, casts, etc.,
be made as early as practicable, wherever they may be obtained.  The
friends of the University in the various sections of the State would
doubtless donate many specimens, if a brief circular, containing a statement of our wants, and instructions for packing and forwarding, were
sent out.
FACULTY.
The committee were also instructed "to suggest a faculty" for the
University. In the entire work of organizing the institution, there is
18
I</P><P><PB ID="p00190019" N="19"> 
no more difficult or important part than this.  On the character and
ability of its faculty, will the character and success of the University
depend, more  than  upon  all other circumstances taken  together.
Buildings, cabinets, libraries and rich endowments will be all in vain,
itf the living agents-the professors-be not men of ripe attainments,
fine culture and eminent teaching powers.
Numerous applications have already flowed in upon the committee, but
the time has been quite too brief, since tile last meeting of the board,
to allow any such careful and extensive inquiries as would justify the
committee in presenting any names at this time.  Self-nominated candidates will always be abundant, but the men we want will need to be
sought for as with lighted candles.  The incumbent of a professor's
chair should be no ordinary man.  In this, its chief seat of learning, in
which it proposes to provide for the highest education of its sons, and
from which, as a great center of science, it seeks to diffuse light to all
the great fields of its industries, the State needs men of the highest type
as scholars and as men. The qualifications of every candidate for a
professorship must be rigidly scrutinized without fear or favor; and
none but men of tried and proven ability must be admitted to a place.
Older and ordinary colleges may do with second rate men; this University can only succeed with the best men.
A good college professor should have the three-fold qualification of
eminent  and extensive  scholarship, at least  in  his department;
thoroughly tested ability to teach; and high-toned, gentlemanly character and culture.  The first two are indispensable qunalifications; the
third will never be overlooked by those who have marked how inevitably and ineffaceably the teacher impresses his manners and habits
upon his pupils.  If culture is the better part of education, high-toned
character and genuine courtesy of manner and feeling are the better
part of culture.
The number of professors must depend upon the extent of the eindowmients and the consequent ability to pay salaries.  Until the trustees shall determine upon the disposition of the land scrip, and thus
approximately determine the prospective extent of its funds, this question of the numerical force of the faculty must remain unsettled.
The corps of instruction may properly embrace four classes of teachers:  1st. Professors, or principal instructors in each department of
study.  2d. Asslstant Professor -younger, or less accomplished teachers, employed in sub-departments, or to aid in departments in which the
work cannot be fully done by one man.  3d. Iectu?ers, or non-resident
Professors-men eminent in some specialty of art or science, who may
be employed to visit the University at specified seasons, and give
courses of lectures. 4th. Tutors, or young men, employed temporarily
to give instruction in the more elementary studies.
The committee would indicate the following as among the more
important departments or chairs of instruction:
1.  The Professorship of Practical and Th-eoretical Agriculture.
2.   "'             of Horticulture.
.~.'"i  "      of Analytical and Practical Mechlanics.
4.   ".of Military Tactics and Engineering.
5.'         i       of Civil Engineering.
6.   of Botany and Vegetable Plivysiology.
19</P><P><PB ID="p00200020" N="20"> 
20
The Professorship of Zoology and Animal Physiology.
. "     "        of Mathematics.
'...           of Chemistry.
0      i       of Geology, Mineralogy and Physical Geography.
...~.        of English Language and Literatutre
i        i.      of 3Modern Languages.
....             of Ancient Languages.
"..      of History and Social Science.
*i.       i      of Miental and Moral Philosophyv.
In addition to these, the committee would suggest the following, lectureships:
The Lectureshlip of Veterinary Science.
"      "       of Commercial Science.
''    "    Iof lHuman Anatomy, Plhysiology) and lygienie.
i  i           of Constitutional, Commercial and Rural Law.
Several of these departments may, at the outset, be represented by
the same man. The professor of botany may also be professor of
horticulture; and the professor of zoology may fill, likewise, the chair
of practical agriculture.  Civil and military engineering may be united
in oine chair; and the professor oft ehemistry may teach also mineralocfy or meteorology.
Thle professor of Practical Agriculture should be the superintendent
of the experimental farm, with such foremen and other laborers under
him as may be necessary to carry out his plans.  The farm is his laboratory and apparatus of instruction, by which he illustrates the scientific
principles and theories which he teaches, and demonstrates both the
truth and the value of his doctrines.  His plans for the treatment of
each field and crop, and for the several experiments to be tried, should
be submiitted to the Regent and Faculty, and after careful discussion
and final adoption by them, or by the Executive committee, should be
put on record as the settled plan for that season, to be carried out under
the caretiful supervision of the superintendent, and its progress and re
suilts fully recorded in the farm record.
In like nmanner, the professor of Horticulture should be superintendent of the gardens and ornamental grounds, and should, in the same
way, present to the'Faculty for their discussion and approval, his plans
for the management of such grounds and gardens.  He, too, when
necessary, may be aided in his work by a iforemnan and other laborers.
The students, in their labors in the gardens or on the farm, will be under
the guidance of the professors whose instructions those labors are designed to illustrate and apply; and thus the lecture room and the field
practice will teach the same truths, and throw upon each other the
light of a niutual illustration.
The proiessor of MIVechanics may have under his care such shops as
may be nee,led on the grounds for purposes of repairs, or of such  new
construetions of any kind as may be easily made.   With a sinall steaml
or caloric engine as a motor power, there mray be run a variety of common machinery, such as the turning lathe, circular saws, mills for grinding feed, etc., and threshing and other machines, which will enable the
instructor in this department to furnish practical illustration of the
principles of mechanics.  The  trutlll taught to the eye is much more
easilv understood and remembered than that which is stated in mere

words.  Every where the practical methods should supplement and
impress the theoretical instruction.
At the Michigan Agricultural College the students repair the farm
tools and make many of them. Several important improvements in
farming implements have already originated there, though they have,
as yet, no ifully provided mechanical department.  Students are also
employed in the erection of new buildings as they are needed, and they
are said to soon excel comlmon workmen in the excellence of their work.
CONCLUSION.
In presenting this preliminary report, the committee purposely hold
in reserve several points of much interest and importance, which they
hope to be able to present finally in a much more definite and satisfactory form than can be done with the information now in hand. Maturer consideration than the time now allowed them has permitted,
may also lead to some modification of certain of the points here presented.
Fully conmprelending the great magnitude and the immeasurable
importance of the enterprise which they are seeking to shape into life
and power, they caii only bespeak for it the wise support and the just
forbearance of all good and intelligent citizens.
An industrial university such as we are planning is, in a large part,
without precedent or example. The field of its labors is as yet almost
untracked in its widest stretches.  The very classes for whom its benefits are designed, are as yet not half persuaded of the importance and
real value of those benefits. The farmers and mechanics, accustomed
to regard higher education as needful and desirable only for professional men, and almost wholly incredulous as to the utility of science in
its applications to their work, will look with slow-coming faith upon a
university which proposes to make firming a scientific employment,
and to lift mechanics into a learned profession. They have, in many
cases, yet to be convinced that a highly cultured mind may be linked
to a brawny hand, and that a classical scholar may feel at home in a
workshop; aye! and find use for all his scholarship and taste in the
successful practice of his art.
But the age is propitious.  The  working masses of mankind are
waking to their needs, and calling for light.  The thunder of the ma.hinery by the side of which they toil, and the magic power of the new
?rocesses of arts which they daily employ, have roused the long slumlering power of thought. Brains are coming into use and honor in all
tie fields of human labor, and brains will speedily demand light and
kiowledge. In an age of learning, the farmer and the mechanic will
son come to covet the rich heritages of science for their sons. Already
th, children of the laboring classes are crowding the public high
sclools. They will not stop there. The University lies the next step
beyond. They will crowd to its doors; and soon will begin to issue
tfron its halls that long column, with its yearly additions, of graduates
witt broad brows, and science-lighted brains, bearing back to the farms
andthlie workshops an intelligent skill and power, to invoke new and
unN)nted fruitfulness firom the soil and from the mechanic's art.  "If
21</P><P><PB ID="p00220022" N="22"> 
I had fifty sons," said a farmer who had reluctantly permitted his
eldest boy to take a course at an agricultural college, and now brought
his youngest to the same college, "If I had fifty sons they should all
go to this college, for my boy, who graduated here, farms so much better
than I ever did, skillful as I thought myselt; that he is getting rich
from his half of the crops he raises on my land, and I live like a prince
on the remainder."
And the light of high and classic learning will be found as beautiful
and becoming when it shines in an educated farmer's home, as when it
gilds the residence of the graduated lawyer or physician. Rich librarics are already seen in the houses of some of our leading agriculturists, and no one has found that they hinder the growth of harvests, or
unfit the hand of the reaper. When our Industrial University shall
have come fully into its work, these libraries will be increased in number, and there will gather around the firesides in our farm houses, and
in the homes of our master mechanics, groups of cultivated and intelligent people, the peers in knowledge, refinement and power of the best
and bravest in the land.
And what richer growths shall yet start from these magnificent prairies
to repay the farmer's toil, and what more splendid achievements shall
yet spring from our myriad-handed mechanic art-what more beautiful
bloom in our gardens, and more delicious frLlits from our orchardswhat more tasteful and convenient homes from our architecture, aild
what grander and more abundant products from our multiplying manufactories-what nobler forms of civilization to grace our free institution, and what better types of manhood to tell of the blessings of liberty and learning, when education shall have fully achieved this last
triumph, and carried her victorious banner of light down into the fields
where the toiling millions of mankind must still, by the stern but beneficent ordination of Heaven, "eat their bread in the sweat of their
brows."
