<HEAD><PB ID="p00030001" N="1">THE OAHU COLLEGE.</HEAD><P>
IN the year 1841, a school was commenced, for the
children of missi6naries,  at <NAME>Punahou</NAME>, near <NAME TYPE="place">Honolulu,
Sandwich  Islands</NAME>.   Five years ago, it was opened to
others besides the children of missionaries. The num ber of pupils has varied from thirty to sixty, and the
whole number or pupils, up to <DATE>September, 1854</DATE>, was one
hundred and twenty-two. In <DATE>May, 1853</DATE>, the Hawaiian
Government incorporated twelve persons, all of them
except one either then or formerly connected with the
mission,  as a corporate. body  by  the name of <HI>"The
Trustees of the Punahou School and Oahu College."</HI>
It is probable that the legal name of the institution will
be shortened, and that it will be called simply the " <HI><NAME>Oahu
College</NAME></HI>."
</P><P>The charter recognizes the design of the institution to
be "the training of youth in the various branches of a
* Christian education,  teaching them  sound  and  useful
knowledge."  It further states, that, "as it is reasonable
that the Christian education should be in conformity to
the general views of the founders and patrons of the
institution, no course of instruction shall be deemed law ful in said institution, which is not accordant with the
principles of Protestant Evangelical Christianity, as held
by that body of Protestant Christians in the United States
o     f      America, which   originated the Christian mission to
the Islands, and to whose labors and benevolent contri-<PB ID="p00040002" N="2">butions the people of these Islands are so greatly indebted." There is also an additional security for the institution in the following article, namely,-" Whenever a
vacancy shall occur in said corporation, it shall be the
duty of the Trustees to fill the same with all reasonable
and convenient dispatch.  And  every new election shall
be immediately made known to the Prudential Commitee
of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions, and be subject to their approval or rejection,
and this power of revision shall be continued  to the
American Board for twenty years from. the date of this
charter."</P></DIV1><DIV1 TYPE="UNS"><HEAD>
The Sandwich Islands Christianized. </HEAD><P> 
The effort. to christianize the <NAME TYPE="place">Sandwich Islands</NAME>, was
begun in the year 1820, and has succeeded beyond any
similar efforts recorded in history.  In the year 1853, a
little more than thirty years from the commencement of
the mission, the Board was able to make proclamation in
the Annual Report, that the people of the<NAME> Sandwich
Islands</NAME> had become a Christian nation.  The proofs then
adduced of this fact were beyond all controversy; such
as entitled the Hawaiian nation to the Christian name, if
any people on earth might claim it; though without that
intellectual development and social culture, which enter
so deeply into the modern idea of civilization.  But even
in respect to these things a vast work had beeni accomplished.</P><P>
It was evident to the Prudential Committee, as early as
the year 1848, that the time had come for a change of some
sort in the relations of the missionaries to the people of the
Islands and to the Board. They saw that new and additional motives must be presented to induce the married
missionaries to remain at the Islands, or the greater part
of them might feel constrained to return to this country
with;n a few years, to make provision for their children.</P><P><PB
ID="p00050003" N="3"> This was not owing simply, nor chiefly, to the number
and age of their children, (for such a result was nowhere
seen in the older missions elsewhere,) but to the novel
and remarkable relations, at that time, of the mission to
the people of the Sandwvich Islands.
</P><P>The problem, as then presented, was, how to give scope
to the parental feelings in missionaries, without increasing
burdens and expenses that could not be borne; though it
soon appeared that there was really a higher problem to
to be solved, and one that was novel in missions, namely,
how to bring the mission itself, as such, to a termination,
dissolving its relations to the Board, and merging its mem bers in the newly created Christian community. The
first problem stated came first in the order of time, and
it involved the solution of the other. It was; how to con vert the Islands into the home of the missionaries, (which
the peculiar relation of the Islands to the commercial
world then rendered possible,) and the missionaries into
citizens and pastors.  This was effected, so far as the
action of the Prudential Committee was concerned, by a
series of resolutions made public in the Report of the
Board for the year 1849. The response of the missiona aries was in general favorable, though it required five
years to complete the arrangement.    The  case  was
unprecedented; there was  no  experience;  every. step
had to be considered in its principles, its equity, and its
expediency. The transition was at length effected, and
thie mission was merged in the general Christian commu nity of the Islands. The meeting of the mission in <DATE>May,
1853</DATE>, was its last meeting in its associated, corporate
character as a mission,-responsible, as such, to the
Board, controlling, as such, the operations of its members.
The relations of the ministry and charches of the Sand wich Islands towards the Board and its patrons, and
towards other foreign missions and the Christian church<PB ID="p00060004" N="4"> 
at large, then became those of an independent Christian
community. The salaries of the native pastors, the cost
of church buildings, and the greater part of the cost of
schools, were to be'met (as in fact they have been) by
the natives. So was the support.of Hawaiian missionaries,'whether sent to <NAME
TYPE="place">Micronesia</NAME>, or to the <NAME TYPE="place">Marquesas
Islands</NAME>. It was only in part, however, that the natives
could support their foreign pastors. The Board, in this
new relation of things, would have to sustain to the new
Christian community a relation like that, which the <NAME>Home
Missionary Society</NAME> sustains to the Christian community
in Oregon or California;  and it might be necessary to
continue this relation for some time.</P></DIV1><DIV1 TYPE="UNS"><HEAD>Native College at Lahainaluna</HEAD><P>
.
The first important step taken at the Islands after the.
mission had responded, in the year 1849, to the proposals
of the Prudential Committee, was the transfer, by the
Board, of the native Seminary or College at Lahainaluna
to the Hawaiian Government. This is wholly for natives.
The transfer was made on the condition, that the institution should continue to cultivate sound literature and
science, and not allow to be taught religious doctrines
contrary to those heretofore inculcated by.the mission.
In case of the non-fulfillment of the conditions, the whole
property, with any additions and improvements made upon
the premises, was to revert to the Board. The goverfment have since sustained two clerical professors obtained
from the company of missionaries, and the institution
answers the purposes of a College for the native community. It is not adapted, however, nor can it be, to the
wants of the foreign community</P></DIV1><DIV1 TYPE="UNS"><HEAD>Necessity for the College at Punahou.
</HEAD><P>
The Oahu College is open to natives speaking the
English language; but it is especially designed for pupils<PB
ID="p00070005" N="5">from that increasing and important portion of the Hawaiian community, which is of foreign origin. This of
course includes those who have heretofore constituted the
mission.  These, with their families, must be regarded as
in the highest degree essential to the religious welfare of
the Islands. Their children, now at. the Islands in a
course of education, not including those  too young for
school, nor those in the-colleges and schools of the United
States, number one hundred and forty-five. To remove
even a considerable portion of these for education to the
United States, would be at great expense and inconvenience, and there is a growing conviction among the
parents, that their children must be chiefly educated there.
"They can there," says one of the most experienced ofthe parents, " be under parental guardianship and home
influences; and this will help to retain both parents and
children in the field. The education will be less perfect
thafi in the United States, but it will fit them better, in
some respects, to labor in the land of their birth, than an
education in a foreign country. The parents will seek
an education for their children elsewhere, if it be not
provided for them at the Islands; but it is believed that
most of them will retain their children there, if a college
be there provided."
</P><P>The number of foreign residents and their descendants
is increasing at the Sandwich Islands. - An intelligent
glance at the future will show, that this enterprising commun    ity       is destined to exert a very conmmanding influence
in that increasingly important part of the world, and that
t h e    necessity of its being well educated cannot be over:
estimated. The foreign. community now springing up at
the Sandwich Islands will inevitably shape the character
and destiny of the whole northern Pacific. The missiona r y    par   t        of this community has now the vantage ground
as regards all good influences, and with the divine bless                      1*

ing is able to mould the literary and religious institutions
of the Hawaiian nation. Religion, just now, has a strong
hold on those Islands.  The present is, therefore, a favor:able time to institute a College, and put it into a working
condition.
</P><P>The necessity for an institution, such as it is proposed
to make of the Oahu College, is one of the most obvious
and interesting fact now presented to our view in that
part of theworld.
</P><P>1. The College is essential to the development and con.tinued existence of the Hawaiian nation. It is so because
the missionary portion is really the palladium of the
anation, and because a College is essential to that part of
the community.  The religious foreign community cannot
otherwise long continue to perform its functions.  It must
have the means of liberally educating its children on the
ground. Without a College, its moral, social and civil
influence will  tend constantly to decay.   This  most
precious Christian influence, now rooted on the Islands,
now no longer exotic, needs only the proper culture to
perpetuate itself. The cheapest thing we can do for the
Islands and for that part of the world, is to furnish this
culture. ft is better to educate our ministry there, than
to send it thither from these remote shores. Indeed we
~are shut up to this, as our main policy.  The providential
indications are perfectly clear. Through the grace of
God and the gospel of his Son, all the means, excepting
such as are pecuniary, for perpetuating Christianity at the
Islands, are already. there. <NAME>Mr. Armstrong</NAME>, the Minister
of Instruction at the Islands, writing to one of the Secretaries of the American Board under date of <DATE>January 2,
1856</DATE>, bears this remarkable testimony:
</P><P>"During the year 1855,. just closed," he says," I
visited all the Islands, and every missionary station, in
the course of my official duty, and had good opportunities
0 -<PB ID="p00090007" N="7">
for seeing how the brethren conduct the affairs of their
respective stations, and the success that -has crowned their
labors.  I found- them all at their posts, hard at work,
watching for souls, and promoting the welfare of their
people in various ways. As a class, they are very laborious and self-denying, and the advancement  of their
people in knowledge, industry, civilization and religion,
is the best evidence of their success. I have lived for
weeks on weeks among the natives,.lodging with them in
their huts, partaking of their homely fare and sleeping on
their mats; and the more I see.of them, the mnore.i bless
God for what he has done for them.  I do not believe
there is a community on earth, of the same number, more
entirely pervaded by the blessed gospel.  In the remotest
corners of the land, I find a Bible and Hymrn-book in
nearly every house, if there was nothing else."</P><P>
We may say of the faithful men,'vho, ceasing to l)e
missionaries in the technical sense, are now laboring as
pastors of churches, superintendents of education, or
professors in the native College, or as physicians, teachers,
editors, or Christian merchants:' "Except these abide
in the ship, ye cannot be saved."  Had the great body of
these mnen left the Islands in the year.1JS48, the native
government could not long have survived the catastrophe;
and now, and for years to come, they wvill be, under God,
the most effectual safeguard the Hadwaiip Government
and people can possibly have.'Remaining there, with
their  irumerous  and healthy families of  children, and
furnished with facilities for educating those children, the
government, the nation, the Islands will continue, with
the ordinary blessing of Heaven, to be Christian, evangelical, a glorious monument of the triumphs of the
gospel, a light enlightening the benighted groups lying
far to the westward, and a cause for admiring gratitude
to the whole Christian world!.           -</P><P><PB ID="p00100008" N="8"> Surely results like these are worth a great outlay for
their preservation; but this cannot be effectually done
without the speedy institution of a College at the Islands,
where a portion of the children of foreign parents, and
some of the more promising of the native youth, may
receive that liberal education which'is deemed so important in this country.
</P><P>2. There is another and highly interesting view of the
subject.   This Christian community  at the Sandwich
Islands,-mixed in blood, but one in Christ,-should be
regarded as a centre of light and influence for the large
number of inhabited but benighted Islands scattered over
the far and vast WEST of the Pacific Ocean.  This missionary enterprise in the insular world beyond, besides its
intrinsic importance, is among the necessary means, by
its reacting influence, of raising the Hawaiian churches
to the point of self-support and self-control; and its value,
in this view, is already delightfully evident. The pecuniary means for supporting missionaries in Micronesia
who are sent from the United States, must of course
come in great measure from this country; but the support of missionaries and native assistants drawn from
the Hawaiian churches, (as well as much of the labor
connected with the details of the business,) may be
thrown upon the' Hawaiian Missionary Society,' which
is independeii of the American Board; and no small
portion of the missionaries may at' leingth be obtained
from among-the alumni of the Oahu College.  Dr. Gulick,
one of the first missionaries to Micronesia, is the son of
a missionary at the Sandwich Islands, though educated in
the United States; and the missionary children at the
Islands are associated together to provide among themselves the means for his support. When the missionary
ship, to be called the' Morning.Star,' which has been
requested for the mission in Micronesia, is actually in<PB ID="p00110009" N="9"> those seas, the proposed institution for educating missionaries inured to the people arxd climate, will become a still
more valuable auxiliary. </P><P>
Thus we see, that the reasonable endowment of the
Oahu  College will be a good use of money for thy up
building of Christ's kingdom at the Sandwich Islands,
and for extending that kingdom throtiugh the islands of the
great ocean beyond.
</P></DIV1><DIV1 TYPE="UNS"><HEAD>Funds and Buildings of the College</HEAD><P>..
Thle. value of the property now belonging to the Oahtu
College, derived chiefly through the American Board, is
estimated as follows: -</P><P>
<TABLE><ROW><CELL>Three hundred acres of land,..-  $9,000</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>College building, two stories,......      7,000
</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>Two dwelling houses,...  6,000</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>Twelve lodging rooms,.......       2,000</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>Dining room, kitchen, etc.,...    1,000

</P><P>The land on which the buildings stand has an excellent
and valuable spring of water, sufficient to irrigate it.
There are one hundred acres in this lot, all enclosed by a
good stone wall, and in part under cultivation. Another
hundred acres adjoining, is also enclosed with a stone
wall, and is devoted to pasturage.   Another  hundred
acres of woodland lies' about two  miles distant.   The
buildings'will suffice for the present.</P><P>
An observer, familiar with the college edifices of the
United States, may hardly be able to recognize a College
in what he sees at Punahou.  But what there is surpasses
what were the visible beginnings of either Harvard, or
Yale. Until the present time, moreover, there has been
only a preparatory school.'IThe first college class, and
that a stnall one, commences the present year.  A  num
*  *<PB ID="p00120010" N="10">ber of young men, once at -Punahou, who would perhaps
have been in the College had there been one, are at
Williams, Yale, or some other of our American Colleges.
Some have completed their preparations for life's business,
and are preachers, missionaries, merchants, or connected
with the government of the Islands.
</P></DIV1><DIV1 TYPE="UNS"><HEAD>The Endowment</HEAD><P>.
The cost of living at the Sandwich Islands has been
'materiallly increased by. the settlement and mines of
California. Just at present, it may ndt be easy to bring
the expenses of a family at Punahou within the bounds
recommended for the salaries of the officers of College.
The arrangement for salaries should be based, however,
on what we know to be the general course of things in
the world. Fifteen hundred dollars, with the use of a
house, is thought not to be too large a salary for the
President of the Oahu  College;  and twelve hundred
dollars, with the use of a house, for a Professor.  The
American Board will pay these two salaries for the years
1856 and 1857.</P><P>
The Trustees propose to raise the sum of ifty thousand dollars. This is not too large a beginning. Of
this sum the Hawaiian government  engages to give ten
thousand dollars, or one fifth part; on condition that the
remaining forty thousand dollars-be raised before July 6,
1858, and that the King have the right of nominating two
of the twelve trustees of the College. The Prudential
Committee have voted to subscribe five thousand dollars
towards the endowment,  on  behalf  of the American
Board,' payable in the year 1858.</P><P>
It should be understood that, excepting the dtuty of
approval or disapproval in respect to the election of members on the Board  of Trustees, laid upon the American
Board by the Charter for the space of twenty years, that
I<PB ID="p00130011" N="11"> Board has no connection whatever with the College, or
control of its proceedings.  The College is an independent institutions sustaining no other relation to the Board,
than it does to every other benefactor.
</P><P>The Colleges of New England had generally some
benevolent patron provided for them by Divine Providence;-a Harvard, a Yale, a Dartmouth, a Brown, a
Bowdoin, a Williams; and the Colleges very properly
took and embalmed their names in the memory of an
enlightened  and refined Christian community.   These
provided  the general endowment.   Many  liberal men
also founded  particular  professorships; or gave funds
for the education of young men of talents and character,
without the means of obtaining a liberal education.   May
the Lord raise up such benefactors for the Oalihu College.
That has grown, as the New England Colleges did, out
of a great religious movement and the wonderful blessing
of God on that movement.   It has a religious object,
and is controlled by a religious influence. The funds
have every practicable guard from perversion. The permanent necessity for such an institution is apparent in the
certainty of a permanent, rising, influential community
on those  admirably situated Islands.   The  independence of the Hawaiian Nation,-which, under present
circumstances, is most favorable to its deveopment,-is
guaranteed  by  the United States, Great  Britain  and
France; and the presumption of its falling under the
dominion of a power foreign to us, is too small to deserve
notice and the influence of the College itself, as already
described, will be one of the most effectual guards against
such a result.  There is not a finer climate in all the
world.  Were it true, that the native population is still
wasting away, the effect of a corrupt commerce in old
heathen times, still greater would be the need of such an<PB
ID="p00140012" N="12">
institution.  A  flourishing community of some kind at
the Sandwich Islands, there certainly will be; and the
religious influences now at the Islands will be as available for that community, as hereafter developed, with
whatever elements, as it will be for the one now
existing.</P><P>
A number of gentlemen have kindly consented, at the
request of the Prudential Committee of the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, acting for
the Trustees of the College, to take charge of the funds
contributed in this country for the Oahu College, (where
the donors do not direct them to be remitted directly to
the Trustees at the Islands;) and they will invest such
funds in the United States, and cause the interest to be
remitted annually to the officer of the corporation legally
authorized to receive it. The Trustees for the Fund,
appointed in the first instance by the Prudential Committee, will fill the vacancies occurring in their own number;
and they will be authorized to transfer the investment of
the funds to the Sandwich Islands whenever they and the
Trustees of the College concur in the opinion, that this
can be safely and advantageously effected.</P><P>
