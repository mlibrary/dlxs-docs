My dear Olive</SALUTE><P>
I am sending you a Madras magazine for you and the boys to read.  Please return after 
perusal.  If you have the time, you will perhaps write a nice letter to the 
Editress for
publication.  As I think I told you before, its contributors are all women.  For 
India it is a
great thing - just that Indian women were never educated before.  But to publish 
a
magazine in a language which is not their mother tongue is rather good.  Don't 
you
think so?  And after all what is education - not surely a mere knowledge of 
letters?  If
you accept the true meaning of the word, I should say most women are educated, -
because they make generally good daughters, as girls, even as you are, good 
wives
and mothers as women, shall I say almost as mother is.
I must not inflict any more on you.  I intended to write only a line but as, 
just now there
is nobody in the office - I beg pardon, a client has just dropped in - I thought 
I might
give you some deciphering work.</P><P>
I want my chocolate please and if father permits you, you may bring my share and 
shall give you for him a gruesome flag.
With love to you all</P><P>
Yours sincerely </P><P>

<DIV2><SALUTE>Dear Mr Doke</SALUTE><P> received your note in Phoenix.  The expected has happened.  I think it is 
well.  I have
arrived just in time.  There were serious differences between two sections here.  
They
are by no means over yet.  You will say I have accepted the hospitality before 
the
'sittings' were finished - I think it was better rejected for the sake of the 
'sitting'.  And
after all I have done nothing.  For six days I may carry on correspondence.  If 
you think
.</P><P>I should answer any questions, you may write</P><P>I must stop as I have been called away to give digit impressions.
</P><P>Please excuse me to Olive for not writing.</P><P>I am  Yours sincerely

paper and pencil hand.</P><P>I have not come to Natal to have rest and am having none.  You wish you were in
Phoenix.  So do I.  You would then have assisted me in nursing Mrs Gandhi.  Now 
that
you may say is very selfish.  But self plays a very important part in our lives.
Many thanks for your good wishes.  
I hope you are enjoying your stay at Orchards.
With Mr Kallenbach and Mr Pollock I once walked to Inanda falls at 4 in the 
morning. </P><P>We returned at 8.  The falls are lovely.  We had a dip there.  The scenery is 
magnificent
- I know, Father, if he visits there, would be bust with his camera.
