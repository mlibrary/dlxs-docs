<H2>HTML is SGML</H2>
<H3>It's just not very good SGML</H3>

<H1>Lines Written in Early Spring</H1>
<H2>William Wordsworth</H2>
<h3>
<P>I heard a thousand blended notes,
<BR>While in grove I sate reclined,
<BR>In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
<BR>Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
<P>To her fair works did nature link
<BR>The human soul that through me ran;
<BR>And much it griev'd me my heart to think
<BR>What man has made of man.
