<DIV CLASS="level1"> 
  <P>When you use XPAT in combination with xmlrgn or sgmlrgn and a DTD, or multirgn 
    and a tags file, you are identifying the elements and attributes in the DTD 
    or tags file as &quot;regions,&quot; containers of content rather like fields 
    in a database. These separate regions are built into the regions file (<EM>collid.rgn</EM>) 
    and are identified in the data dictionary (<EM>collid.dd</EM>). This is what 
    happens when you run sgmlrgn and/or xmlrgn. </P>
  <P>However, sometimes the things you want to identify collectively aren't so 
    handily identified as elements in the DTD. For example, suppose you want to 
    search within specific features of a book, such as a chapter, that can occur 
    at different heirarchical levels in different volumes. Also, the element isn't 
    even called CHAPTER; it's a numbered division with a type attribute telling 
    you that it's a chapter. </P>
  <P>In order to fabricate a region containing all the divisions in books that 
    are chapters, for example you can first find all the regions with a query: 
  </P>
  <PRE CLASS="unixcommand">(region DIV1 incl 
(region &quot;DIV1-T&quot; incl &quot;type=chapter&quot;))+ (region DIV2 incl 
(region &quot;DIV2-T&quot; incl &quot;type=chapter&quot;))</PRE>
  <P>You could do a more complex search based on treating attributes as regions 
    instead of text strings, which is functionally the same:</P>
  <PRE CLASS="unixcommand">(region DIV1 
incl (region &quot;DIV1-T&quot; incl (region &quot;A-TYPE&quot; incl chapter)))+ 
(region DIV2 incl (region &quot;DIV2-T&quot; incl (region &quot;A-TYPE&quot; incl 
chapter)))</PRE>
  <P>In fact, you can even create a region </P>
  <P>Finally, once you have a query that produces the results you want, create 
    a file for export, export it, and sync it:</P>
  <PRE CLASS="unixcommand">{exportfile &quot;$DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid/chapter.rgn&quot;} 
export ~sync &quot;chapter&quot; </PRE>
  <P>Why fabricate regions? Why not just put these queries in the map file and 
    call them chapters? While you could, it's probably worth your time to build 
    these succinctly-named and precompiled regions; query errors are more easily 
    identified in the index building than in the CGI, and XPAT searches can be 
    simpler and quicker for terms within the prebuilt regions. </P>
  <P>Fabricated regions within Text Class can be found in the <EM>extra.srch</EM> 
    file for the sample collection at <TT CLASS="unixcommand">$DLXSROOT/prep/s/sampletc/sampletc.extra.srch</TT> 
    . As with any other elements used in the interface for a given collection, 
    fabricated regions used must also be represented in the collmgr entry and 
    the map file for that collection. </P>
