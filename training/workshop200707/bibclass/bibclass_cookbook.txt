- before anything, ask to have new bib coll authorized: public access and hosted on hti
- also have stats entry created for new bib coll
- the xml file should be in /l1/prep/d/dlpscoll/dlpstext/new/ or /l1/prep/d/dlpscoll/dlpsimage/new or /l1/prep/d/dlpscoll/spotext/new
- move xml file to /l1/obj/d/dlpscoll
- on sangria, index the xml file
cd /l1/idx/d/dlpscoll
- cp the bib-sample.dd
cp bib-sample.dd busadwp-bib.dd
- edit busadwp-bib.dd so that /l1/obj/b/bib-sample/bib-sample becomes /l1/obj/d/dlpscoll/busadwp-bib in the three places it's needed
- create the init file for this coll
cp bib-sample.init busadwp-bib.init
- find out how big your obj file is
ls -la /l1/obj/d/dlpscoll/busadwp-bib.xml
- index the file
xpatbldu -m [x]m -D busadwp-bib.dd 
- where [x] = up to two times the size of the busadwp-bib.xml file, but no more than 75% of the RAM on the server
- multirgn -f -D busadwp-bib.dd -t bib-regions.tags
- add a record in collmgr

- move your index from sangria to clamato and dlps10, and thus production
cd /l1/bin/b/bib
rdist -f rdist.dlpscoll -m clamato.umdl.umich.edu
rdist -s hti -f rdist.dlpscoll
- authorize yourself to look at the collection, before it is officially authorized
cd /l1/dev/[uniqname]/cgi/b/bib
- add busadwp-bib to AUTHZD_COLL
- create an HTML index page for your collection.
cd /l1/dev/[uniqname]/web/d/dlpscoll
mkdir busadwp-bib
cvs add busadwp-bib
cp sample_index.tpl busadwp-bib
cd busadwp-bib
mv sample_index.tpl index.tpl
- open the index.tpl file and change the <title> and <h2> tags to reflect the full name of the collection, and add the description from colldescr
- cvs add index.tpl
- cvs commit index.tpl
- update the release script to incorporate these for release.
cd /l1/dev/[uniqname]/bin/b/bib
- add '/web/d/dlpscoll/busadwp-bib' => '-R', # recurse to cvstag.bib
cvs commit cvstag.bib
- find the range of dates in the collection
- go back to sangria
xpatu /l1/idx/d/dlpscoll/busadwp-bib.dd
region YR
{savefile "dates"}
save.region.1
/l1/prep/d/dlpscoll/scripts/daterange.pl dates | sort | uniq | more
- go back to the record in collmgr and add:
minmaxyearstart = [first date]
minmaxyearend = [last date]
- look at everything at http://[uniqname].dev.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/b/bib/bib-idx?c=busadwp-bib
- choose the groups you want to add the collection to in collmgr
- for OAI, choose the oaiall group
