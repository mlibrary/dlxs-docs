Multiple Releases
-----------------

        Two DLXSROOT values and two databases

            install into distince DLXSROOT dirs

            because each release has a different achema

                    MySQL

                        dump old into new and upgrade with new utils

             New virtual host for each

                    Each virtual host has one of the DLXSROOT values

                    DLXSDATAROOT is *same* for each virtual host so
                    data is shared
