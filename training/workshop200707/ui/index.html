<hr size="1" width="90%">
<p>This document describes the key aspects of DLXS User Interface technology.
  It is intended as a fairly high level overview. It applies to DLXS Image, Text,
  and FindAid Classes, but not Bib Class which lags behind in support for XML
  and XSL. </p>
<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The DLXS Classes are CGI based web applications written using the Perl
  programming language. The CGIs operate
   between the web server and the data, and are also known as <em>middleware</em>.
  The middleware is designed to keep data handling tasks separate from user interface
  tasks as much as possible. The combination of Perl programming code, XML, and
  XSLT help to achieve this. Each page served  is created by generating
  an XML data document and transforming it using XSLT to HTML for display in
   the browser. </p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this documentation to teach the fundamentals of
  Perl, XML, XSLT and HTML. You may find you can comprehend most of
  this documentation even if you are not very familiar with some of the technologies.
  We will start with a high level view, increasing the complexity as we go. </p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates how a CGI takes an  XML template,
  populates it with data, and transforms it to HTML using an XSL stylesheet.</p>
<div class="level2"><img src="graphics/dlxsxmlxslhtml.png" width="522" height="397" border="1"></div>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2><a name="BreakdownofComponents"></a>Breakdown of Components</h2>
<h3><a name="XMLTemplates"></a>XML Templates</h3>
<p>An XML template exists for every page in the DLXS system. An XML
  template is an XML file that contains
  placeholders, called <strong>Processing Instructions</strong>. It is the starting
  point for what will be an XML document full of dynamically generated data. </p>
<p>Templates vary depending on the purpose of the page. A search form page has
  different requirements that a search results page, and the templates reflect
  this. </p>
<p>Take a look at this complete <a href="search_template.xml" target="_blank">XML template</a> (Not
  all browsers can display XML. Try Firefox.).
  It is for a
  search form page in Text Class.</p>
<h3><a name="XML"></a>XML</h3>
<p>The CGI produces an XML document as a result of replacing a templates <strong>Processing
    Instructions</strong>. The XML contains all of the data to be displayed in
    the browser, however, the it lacks the formatting instructions needed by
    the browser to display an attractive and functional user interface. </p>
<p>Take a look at this <a href="search.xml" target="_blank">XML </a> document.
  It is the template above after having the PIs replaced by the CGI.</p>
<p>XML documents used in the user interface are totally different than the XML
  documents that hold content such as the full text of a book or an electronic
  Finding Aid, though portions of content will  replace PIs in the XML for search
  results page. If you want to know more about preparing data as XML, see <a href="http://dlxs.org/docs/13/data/index.html">Data
  Issues for DLXS</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="ProcessingInstructions"></a>Processing Instructions</h3>
<p><strong>Processing Instructions</strong> or<strong> PIs</strong> are replaced
  by the CGI with
  dynamically generated data such as search results, and information used to
  construct menus, forms and links in the user interface. Every Processing Instruction
  is paired with a handler in the CGI for replacing the PI with data or other
  information. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="unixcommand">&lt;?PI_IDENTIFIER_NAME [modifiername=&quot;value&quot;]*?&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above you can see the generic form of a Processing Instruction. PIs can optionally
  have modifiers, though most do not. Modifiers pass additional information to
  the CGI, affecting the replacement. </p>
<p>Processing Instructions are usually wrapped by XML tags for structure and
  context. Some PIs get replaced by small amounts of data, such as the word &quot;true&quot;
  or &quot;false&quot;, while others are replaced by large amounts of data, sometimes containing
  additional XML tags.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a  snippet of the XML template. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/xmltemplatesnip.png" alt="Snippet of XML Template showing Processing Instructions." width="530" height="280" border="1"></p>
<p>Next you see the  snippet of the XML after Processing Instructions
  have been replacedby the CGI. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/xmlsnip.png" alt="The snippet of the XML after Processing Instructions have been replacedby the CGI." width="530" height="277" border="1"></p>
<h3><a name="XSL"></a>XSL</h3>
<p>XSL is the programming language used to transform the XML to HTML. An XSL
  program is more commonly called an XSL Stylesheet. Each XML file specifies
  the XSL Stylesheet to be used for transformation. It is common in DLXS for
  one stylesheet to incorporate several other stylesheets stored in separate
  files (for the convenience of sharing code). More on this later.</p>
<p>Take a look at this <a href="searchforms.xsl" target="_blank">XSL Stylesheet</a>.
  It is one of the stylesheets used to transform XML to HTML for the search form
  page in Text Class. You might notice that XSL resembles XML. In fact, it <strong>is</strong>  XML.
  XML takes on many different forms, one is XSL. You might also notice that an
  XSL stylesheet contains XSL templates. An XSL template is a little bit like
  a subroutine or function in other programming languages, and are not to be
  confused with <a href="#XMLTemplates">XML templates</a>. </p>
<p>The diagram below shows the snippet of XSL that transforms the XML above to
  HTML. </p>
<pre><img src="graphics/xslsnip.png" alt="The snippet of XSL that transforms the XML to HTML." width="521" height="294" border="1"></pre>
<h4><a name="HTML"></a>HTML</h4>
<p>HTML is the format output by the CGI to the browser. It is the result of applying
  the XSL Stylesheet to the XML.</p>
<p>Take a look at this <a href="search_htmlsource.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>.
  It is the complete HTML source for the Text Class search form.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the snippet of HTML generated by transforming the
  XML with XSL. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/htmlsnip.png" alt="The snippet of HTML that is the result of the XML to HTML transformation with XSL." width="521" height="237" border="1"> </p>
<h3><a name="LanguageMap"></a>Language Map</h3>
<p>All text that appears as part of the user interface is stored in an XML file.
  Phrases are assigned keys, and the keys are used in the XSL to retrieve phrases.
  The potential exists to have interfaces in different languages. A default map
  resides in the web directory for each Class and is called langmap.en.xml. The
  CGI incorporates the map file into the XML file. </p>
<h3><a name="Javascript"></a>Javascript</h3>
<p>Javascript is another key technology that plays a role in the user interface.
  Like CSS, Javascript is applied by the browser, not the server.</p>
<h3><a name="CSS"></a>Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</h3>
<p>DLXS uses CSS extensively to further refine the layout of the HTML. Cascading
  Stylesheets are very different from XSL Stylesheets. XSL Stylesheets affect
  the structure of the HTML document (e.g., the hierarchy of the elements). Cascading
  Stylesheets affect the display of the HTML structure. CSS is great for formatting
  with fonts and colors, and it can even be used to show or hide a portion of
  the HTML. CSS is applied by the browser, not the server.</p>
<h3><a name="CollectionManager"></a>Collection Manager</h3>
<p>Some of the most common customizations can be done in Collection Manager.
  For example, the title of the collection. Image Class can be customized quite
  extensively in Collection Manager. For example, the display of data fields
  can be configured extensively. Customizations are relatively easy to make in
  Collection Manager. Use it whenever possible. </p>
<h2><a name="Fallback"></a>Fallback</h2>
<p>Fallback is a mechanism  used by DLXS CGIs to handle the task of selecting
  user interface files (e.g., XML templates) based on whether the end user is
  working at the class, group, or collection level, and whether user interface
  customizations have been made.</p>
<p>DLXS allows  collection specific user interface customizations.
  Similarly, groups of collections can share a custom interface. The DLXS Classes
  each have a default interface that is used if there are no customizations at
  the group or collection levels. </p>
<p>When the CGI needs a user interface file, for example, search.xml for the
  text class search form, the Fallback mechanism considers a number of factors
  when choosing a file.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How many collections are involved? </li>
  <li>Is a group involved?</li>
  <li>Does the file exist
    in the collection's web directory?</li>
  <li>Does the collection have a default
  group?</li>
  <li>Does the file exist in the group's
    web directory?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fallback is  complex due to the vast number possible situations,
  but has great benefits. It allows very specific aspects of the user interface
  to be customized while all other aspects <em>fall
  back</em> to the defaults at the group or class level. This  reduces
  duplication and in the long term minimimizes maintenance work (and the headaches
  that go with it). </p>
<p><strong>The principle
    idea is to duplicate code as little as possible, and utilize fallback as
    much as possible.</strong></p>
<p>All user interface files are stored in the file system under $DLXSROOT/web.  </p>
<p>There is a directory for files shared across the classes called &quot;lib&quot; and
  located at $DLXSROOT/web/lib. </p>
<p>Each class has a directory in &quot;web&quot;.</p>
<ul>
  <li>i/image</li>
  <li>t/text</li>
  <li>f/findaid</li>
  <li>b/bib</li>
</ul>
<p>If a group or collection requires customization, it may be necessary to create
  a web directory based on the group or collection ID. </p>
<ul>
  <li>c/collid (e.g., a/amverse)</li>
  <li>g/groupid (e.g., b/bhl)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see a report of the Fallback file selection process by adding <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?debug=tpl;page=simple&c=amverse" target="_blank">debug=tpl</a>  to
  the URL. The CGI first checks for a file in the collection level directory,
  then group, and finally at the class level. </p>
