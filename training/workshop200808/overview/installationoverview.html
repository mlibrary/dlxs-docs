<H2> Installation of DLXS Middleware and XPAT</H2>
<P><B>XPAT</B>: should be installed by the sysadmin or someone with root rights.</P>
<P><B>DLXS Middleware</B> is installed through the running of an installation 
  script which is delivered on the DLXS CD-ROM. It expands tar files into a <A HREF="dirstructure.html">DLXS 
  directory structure</A>. </P>
<P>The installation process:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Create a DLXS root directory. At DLPS we use <TT>/l1/</TT>, but you can 
    call it anything you like.</LI>
  <LI>Insert the CD-ROM and open it</LI>
  <LI>Run the installation script 
    <OL>
      <LI>script will check your environment</LI>
      <LI>ask about the location of several pieces of software (such as your Perl 
        installation and certain Perl modules)</LI>
      <LI>install DLXS middleware</LI>
      <LI>configure files</LI>
      <LI>create text snippets (for other systems) which will need to be added/inserted 
        by a sysadmin</LI>
    </OL>
  </LI>
</OL>
<P>Note: <I> (for this workshop, only one XPAT installation, but one entire Middleware 
  and data installation with DLXSROOT and virtual host per participant)</I></P>
