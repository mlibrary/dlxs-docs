TO HON. GEORGE P. MARSH,
UNITED STATES MINISTER RESIDENT AT CONSTANTINOPLE.
DEAR Sla,
I dedicate this little Volume to you, not in your capacity as the honored
Representative of your country at a Foreign Court, nor yet in your higher character, as
one of the foremost scholars of the age; but rather, as is m(re befitting, ill token of omy
esteem for your private virtues, and in grateful acknowledgment of your personal friendship. I hesitate less to avail myself of your kind permission to use your name in this
place, since it was greatly owing to your flattering judgment of my first elaborate essay at
verse writing, that other pieces were subsequently undertaken, and that these are now
here collected. In christening the book, I have chosen, for several reasons, to conform to
the customary nomenclature which allows every kind of literature to be' Poetry,' that is
not written in the fashion of prose; yet I have no quarrel with that nicer rule of modern
criticism which assigns to all metrical compositions of a mainly facetious or satirical eharacter, a place rather on the border than fairly within the domain of legitimate poesy. If
I have excluded several trifles which some of my friends would like to have seen with the
rest, it was because I could not afford to make the volume larger at any risk of makineg it
worse. Should the verses which I have ventured to retain, receive, in their present form,
the favor wlich has been accorded to most of the poems separately, I am very sure no one
will be more gratfiied than yourself, - except it be
Your sincere Friend, and humble Servant,
JOHN GODFREY SAXE.
UiRLINGTOXN, VERMONT, 1849.

P O E M S.
PRO G RES S:
A SATIRE'.
IN this, our happy and' progressive' age,
When all alike ambitious cares engage;
When beardless boys to sudden sages grow,
And' Miss' her nurse abandons for a beau;
When for their dogmas Non-Resistants fight,
When dunces lecture, and when dandies write
When, martial honors to the children thrown,
Each five-foot minor is a' Major' grown;
When matrons, seized with oratoric pangs,
Give happy birth to masculine harangues,
And spinsters, trembling for the nation's fate,
Neglect their stockings to preserve the State;
(11)



&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;PB REF="00000016.tif" SEQ="00000016" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNSPEC" CNF="887" N="12"&gt;
12                  PROGRESS:
When critic-wits their brazen lustre shed
On golden authors whom they never read,
With parrot praise of' Roman grandeur' speak,
And in bad English eulogize the Greek;
When facts like these no reprehension bring,
May not, uncensured, an Attorney sing?
In sooth he may; and though' unborn' to climb
Parnassus' heights, and' build the lofty rhyme,'
Though FLACCUS fret, and warningly advise'That' middling verses gods and men despise,'
Yet will he sing, to Yankee license true,
In spite of Horace and' Minerva' too!
My theme is PROGRESS, - never-tiring theme,Of prosing dulness, and poetic dream;
Beloved of Optimists, who still protest
Whatever happens, happens for the best;
Who prate of' evil'as a thing unknown,
A fancied color, or a seeming tone,
A vague chimera cherished by the dull,
The empty product of an emptier skull.
Expert logicians they! - to show at will,
By ill philosophy, that nought is ill!
Should some sly rogue, the city's constant curse,
Deplete your pocket and relieve your purse,



&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;PB REF="00000017.tif" SEQ="00000017" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNSPEC" CNF="883" N="13"&gt;
A SATIRE.                    13
Or if, approaching with ill-omened tread,
Some bolder burglar break your house and head,
Hold, friend, thy rage! nay, let the rascal flee,
No evil has been done the world,, or thee:
Here comes Philosophy will make it plain
Thy seeming loss is universal gain!'Thy heap of gold was clearly grown too great,-'Twere best the poor should share thy large estate;;
While'misers gather, that the knaves' should steal,.
Is most conducive to the general weal;
Thus thieves the wrongs of avarice efface,
And stand the friends and stewards of the race;
Thus every moral ill but serves, in fact,
Some other equal ill to counteract.'
Sublime Philosophy! &mdash; benignant light 
Which sees in every pair of wrongs, a right;
Which finds no evil or in sin or pain,
And proves that decalogues are writ in vain V
Hail, mighty PROGRESS!-loftiest we find"
Thy stalking strides in science of the mind.
What boots it now that LoCKE was learned and wise?
What boots it now that men have ears and eyes?' Pure Reason' in their stead now hears and sees,
And walks apart in stately scorn of these;



&lt;/P&gt;
