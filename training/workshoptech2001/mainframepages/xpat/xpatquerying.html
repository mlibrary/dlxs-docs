Query Language Details</H3>

Some documentation can be found at: <A href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/sgml/pat/pat50manual.html" target="external">http://www.hti.umich.edu/sgml/pat/pat50manual.html</A>

<P>Some <A href="./xpatotherdetails.html">further detail</A> concerning Query 
  Language is available. 
<P>We're going to start out in user mode, and shift into what's called <TT>{quieton}</TT> 
  and <TT>{quieton raw}</TT> once some basic concepts have been demonstrated. 
  In the first few sections, I'm going to non-chalantly introduce items that I 
  won't fully explain until the section on operators and relationships.
<P><BR>
  <A NAME="Invoking"></A> 
<HR width="50%">

<H4> Invoking <TT>xpat</TT></H4>

We've come all this way to in the end type a command like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">% xpat /l1/idx/b/bosnia/bosnia.dd</FONT></B></BLOCKQUOTE>



<HR width="50%">

<BR><A NAME="Points"></A>

<H4>

Identifying Points</H4>

In XPat a point is some unique <I>byte</I> offset in the full text under

consideration, corresponding to those places where XPat was told to begin

sistrings. We get a set (see below for a more formal discussion of sets)

of points by performing a search for a string or a particular offset:

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">>> "mulberry"</FONT>

<BR><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">>> "mulberry "</FONT>

<BR><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">>> mulberry</FONT>

<BR><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">>> [118312]</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

The first finds all sistrings that begin with <FONT face="Courier New,Courier">mulberry</FONT>,

the second finds those that are <FONT face="Courier New,Courier">"mulberry"</FONT>

exactly, third finds the byte offset for the byte <FONT face="Courier New,Courier">118312</FONT>,

and the fourth is the same as the first.

<P>Searching for something that doesn't exist in the database gets you

zero results, or a point set with zero members:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">>> "syzygy"

&nbsp; 4: no match</FONT></PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="history"></A>NOTE: XPat supports the <FONT face="Courier New,Courier">history</FONT>

command, through which you could get a list of all sets created in the

session, and the command that created them.

<P><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; >> history</FONT>

<BR>

<HR width="50%"><A NAME="Regions"></A>

<H4>

Identifying Regions</H4>

A region in XPat is a span of text comprising zero or more bytes. <TT>sgmlrgn50</TT> 
(discussed in the Encoding Workshop site) handles the create of these regions. 
<P>The <FONT face="Courier New,Courier">{ddinfo regionnames} </FONT>command

will list all the currently-defined regions, and from this list we can

find out about particular regions:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT face="Courier New,Courier">>> region DIV1

&nbsp; 1: 113 matches

>> region "A-NODE"

&nbsp; 2: 125 matches</FONT></PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

That is, the <TT>region</TT> command followed by the name of some region (remembering 
that regions with non-alphanumerics in its name must be double-quoted) evaluates 
to the number of members in that region. There are 113 DIV1 regions and 125 A-NODE 
regions above.
<P>Looking for a region that is not defined gets you a result set of "-1"

and an error message.

<P>See about <TT><A href="#ERROR">ERROR</A></TT> .

<BR>

<HR width="50%"><A NAME="Sets"></A>

<H4>

Identifying Sets (Numbered and Named Sets)</H4>

Any collection of zero or more points or regions can be grouped together

in a set, sets can be combined or split with XPat's boolean operators,

all sets created during a session have unique number identifier, one can

give them names, sets can be printed out, saved, exported and imported.

I gloss over some operators and commands here until the next section.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

The <B>vsearchnext</B> = <B>6</B> line is interesting: 6 is a number, it might 
be a character you want to search for. So is XPat definitely looking for a numbered 
set in this session, or the number 6? Another reason to always put search terms 
in quotes. A command like <B>vearchnext</B><TT> = 243</TT> where the 243 is a 
number that is larger than the set number for the last-created set will result 
in an error. 
<P>There are additionally two special commands to create subsets of sets:

<DL>

<DT>

<TT>subset.X.Y A</TT></DT>



<DD>

Make a new set that consists of Y members of A, starting at the Xth member

of A. Members of A start numbering at 1.</DD>



<DD>

This command is used to get result content in slices.</DD>



<DT>

<TT>sample.X A</TT></DT>



<DD>

Make a new set that consists of X members of A, selected from A of size

Y such that each <SUP>Y</SUP>/<SUB>X</SUB>th is in the new set.</DD>

</DL>

How does XPat know which member of a set is the "first", "second", and so on. 
This is set with the <B>(s<TT>ortorder}</TT></B> setting.&nbsp; TextClass uses 
only: <TT>{sortorder occur}</TT>, which is to say that results are returned in 
the byte order in which they occur in the source text: the byte offset of a member 
of a set is &lt;= the byte offset of the next member, if any. TextClass as it 
stands orders results for display to the user by occurance order, and any ordering 
other than that is accomplished outside XPat, in the InitIterator method. There 
are other <TT>{sortorder}</TT> settings used by XPat, but we have so far not used 
them in the Middleware. See <TT><A href="#settings">{settings}</A></TT> below 
more on the different settings. 
<P>

<HR width="50%"><A NAME="Operators"></A>

<H4>

Operators and Relations</H4>

After tantalizing with various operators, weI'll now actually define the

ones we use most in the form in which they trpically occur.&nbsp; You may

wish to refer to nn even more detailed discussion.

<DL>

<DT>

<B><TT>A ^ B</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

the "and" or "intersection" operator: A and B are two sets, or expressions

that evaluate to sets, and the resulting set includes those points or regions

in both A and B that have the exact same start offsets.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A + B + C + ...</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

the "or" or "union" operator: A, B, C... are sets, the resulting set is

a point set if at least one of the sets being combined is a point set,

consisting of the start offsets of all the points or regions in the original

sets. If <I>all</I> the sets being combined are region sets, then regions

that nest inside other listed regions (either entirely or at their start

byte offset) will be removed from the resultant set.</DD>



<DD>

We saw an earlier example of the "+" operator.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A incl B</TT></B></DT>



<BR><B><TT>A not incl B</TT></B>

<DD>

A is a region set, B is either point or region, the result is a region

set of all members of A that contain at least one member of B, containment

meaning that a given B has a start offset within the inclusive range of

a given A's start and end offsets.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A within B</TT></B></DT>



<BR><B><TT>A not within B</TT></B>

<DD>

In many ways the complement to incl: A is a point or region set, B is a

region set, the resulting set is all members of A that are contained (by

the start offset rule as under incl) in any B. This also takes the not

operator to return all A's that are not within any B.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A near B</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

A and B are either points or regions, and # is either explicitly stated,

or taken from the <TT>{proximity}</TT> setting (see about <TT><A href="#settings">{settings}</A></TT>

below). The result is all A's whose start offsets are within the specified

number of bytes of the start offset of any B. The not form returns all

A's whose start offsets are not within the specified number of bytes from

the start offset of any B. The nearest B might be earlier or later in the

source file.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>A fby B</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

This is just as the near operator, save that an A must be followed within

the specified number of bytes by a B to be in the result set. This also

takes the not operator.</DD>



<DT>

<B>not</B></DT>



<DD>

This reverses the sense of the expression it modifies, usable with <B>incl</B>,

<B>within</B>,

<B>near</B>,

and <B>fby</B>.</DD>

</DL>



<HR width="50%"><A NAME="UsingOps"></A>

<H4>

Using the Operators to Make Sets of Interest</H4>

Now that we have our basic concepts and operators, let's get in there and

do some searching and <I>document analysis</I>: the process by which we

figure out what is there and <B>how the DTD was applied to this SGML</B>,

and <B>what of it we can use</B>. When developing an online system, this

is the most important step. Some important commands will be introduced

in this experimentation.

<P>What a <I>set of interest</I> is is entirely up to the user, and the

notion of user ranges from developers to content specialists to the patrons

floating around out there. I'm going to walk through some increasingly

complicated possible sets of interest here.

<P>We ignore in this section the matter of displaying retrieved results.

That comes in a later section.

<DL>

<DT>

<I>find all the words that start with "diff", and find all the words that

are "different" exactly</I></DT>



<PRE>>> "diff"&nbsp;

&nbsp; 8: 354 matches

>> "different "

&nbsp; 9: 134 matches

>></PRE>



<PRE><I>find all the "gate" follows "vardar"</I></PRE>

>> "vardar " fby "gate "

<BR>&nbsp; 1: one match

<BR>>>

<P>Now some actual examples from the TextClass implementation.&nbsp; This

query is actually the basis for the fabricated region called <B><I>mainauthor

</I></B>in

Bosnia<B><I> </I></B>and illustrates<B> within:</B>

<P>>><TT> ((region AUTHOR within (region TITLESTMT within region FILEDESC))

not within (region SOURCEDESC))</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp; 17: 4 matches</TT>

<P>The motivation here depends on knowing that the AUTHOR element appears

within the TITLESTMT and that the TITLESTMT element appears within both

the FILEDESC and indirectly within the SOURCEDESC element:

<P><TT>&lt;!ELEMENT fileDesc - - (titleStmt, ..., (sourceDesc)+)></TT>

<BR><TT>&lt;!ELEMENT titleStmt - - ((title)+, (author | editor | respStmt)*)></TT>

<BR><TT>&lt;!ELEMENT sourceDesc - - (p | bibl | biblFull)+></TT>

<BR><TT>&lt;!ELEMENT biblFull - - (titleStmt, ..., (sourceDesc)*)></TT>

<P>Here is a simplified query using intersection (<B>^</B>) to fetch the

regions that are notes in Bosnia

<BR>sgml.&nbsp; The full-blown form is the union of DIV2 and P tags in

addition ot DIV1 tags.

<P><TT>>> (region "DIV1-T" incl "NODE=aas7611.0001.001:11")</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp;<B>1</B>: one match</TT>

<BR><TT>>> region DIV1 ^ 1</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp;<B>2</B>: 7 matches</TT>

<P>So we have the DIV1 regions which correspond exactly with DIV1 tags

containing the "id" attribute, which is how notes are marked up in Yeats.

<P>Suppose we constructed a query which has returned a PSet consisting

of hits on a term the user has entered to search on and now we would line

to display the immediate context of the hit and also a title from an&nbsp;

enclosing division:

<P>The query for the user's search is simply:

<P><TT>>> <B>firstsearch</B> = ("Branivoj " + "Branivoj&lt;")</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp; <B>2</B>:&nbsp; firstsearch = one match</TT>

<P>To get an division title for the hit we need to build up regions based

on the hit:

<P><TT>>> <B>slicesearch</B> = subset.1.25 *<B>firstsearch</B></TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp; <B>3</B>: slicesearch = one match</TT>

<BR><TT>>> <B>mainslicesearch</B> = (region DLPSTEXTCLASS incl *<B>slicesearch</B>)</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp; <B>4</B>: mainslicesearch = one match</TT>

<BR><TT>>> <B>mainheader</B> = (region HEADER within *<B>mainslicesearch</B>)</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp; <B>5</B>: mainheader = one match</TT>

<P>Finally to view the content of the region we have constructed we do:

<P><TT>>> pr.region.mainheader (region <B>mainheader</B>)</TT>

<P>The next section discusses the <B>pr</B> command which is the heart

of viewing sets. Of course, we are not finished at this point.&nbsp; Getting

the data back from XPat is just one step.&nbsp; It is followed by filtering&nbsp;

operations (perl substitutions using regular expressions) to remove other

tags that may be mucking up our content and to change the appearance tof

the content e.g. highlighting hits, etc.</DL>



<HR width="50%"><A NAME="Viewing"></A>

<H4>

Viewing the Sets We've Constructed</H4>

Now what we've all been waiting for, we have some results or sets of interest,

and we want to look at them. The two commands for viewing results are <B><TT>pr</TT></B>

and <TT>save</TT>. In a sense, they are really the same command: <TT>pr</TT>

displays to STDOUT, <TT>save</TT> displays to <TT>{savefile}</TT>. Since

they behave the same way, I will use <TT>pr</TT> in my examples.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE:</B> <TT>save</TT> <I>appends</I> to the current <TT>{savefile}</TT>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The kind of text for each result that XPat returns with <TT>pr</TT> and

<TT>save</TT>

is determined by the current <TT>{quieton}</TT> setting (which see, below

under <TT><A href="#settings">{settings}</A></TT>). There is a big difference

between the normal user-sitting-at-the-pat-terminal interaction mode, and

the machine-readable modes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<DL>

<DT>

<B><TT>pr (point-set)</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

This prints out up to <TT>{ordersize}</TT> (see <TT><A href="#settings">{settings}</A></TT>

below) members of the point-set, starting with the first, according to

the current <TT>{sortorder}</TT> setting.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>pr.X shift.-Y (point-set)</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

For the first results in (point-set), a string X bytes wide, offset to

the left of the matching point Y bytes. X and Y overide the <TT>{settings}</TT>

of <TT>{printlength}</TT> and <TT>{leftcontext}</TT> respectively, which

see below.</DD>



<DT>

<B><TT>pr.region."region-name" (region-set of type "region-name")</TT></B></DT>



<DD>

prints the entire span of the members in (region-set). This is a bit of

a pain; to have to tell XPat the "format" of the region you would like

to see, when it should already know!</DD>



<DT>

<TT>pr</TT></DT>



<BR><TT>pr %</TT>

<BR><TT>pr.X shift.-Y</TT>

<DD>

All these are variations on "print the last set created".</DD>

</DL>



<HR width="50%">

<H4>

<A NAME="settings"></A><TT>{settings}</TT></H4>

These are settings that control certain behaviors of XPat during a search

session. There is only one setting that our programs use explicitly as

a set options command, the <TT>{quieton}</TT> command. The other settings

that are used by TextClass search strategies are made explicit through

the commands in which they are relevant, and aren't ever set with a set

options type command. I list here the <TT>{quieton}</TT> variants used

in TextClass, and then those <TT>{settings}</TT> explicitly used in commands

but not set per se. There are other <TT>{settings}</TT> that we don't use.

<DL>

<DT>

<B><TT>{quieton}</TT></B></DT>



<BR><B><TT>{quieton raw}</TT></B>

<BR><B><TT>{quietoff}</TT></B>

<DD>

<TT>{quieton}</TT> and <TT>{quieton raw}</TT> change the interaction mode

of XPat from whatever it was to one of the quieton modes.&nbsp; The <TT>{quieton}</TT>

modes have no user command prompt; multiple commands are separated with

a ;, and zero or more ;-separated commands are sent to XPat with a newline.

XPat returns information about sets and prints out results delimited by

special tags:</DD>



<DL>

<DT>

<TT>SSize</TT></DT>



<DD>

SSize tags surround a number, meaning that the set created by the search

corresponding to this SSize has number-many members.</DD>



<DT>

<TT>RSet</TT></DT>



<DD>

When a region set is printed, all the members of the set printed are surrounded

by a pair of of <TT>RSet</TT> tags. In <TT>{quieton}</TT> mode, each result

from the region set consists of two tags:</DD>



<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&lt;Start>#&lt;/Start>&lt;End>#&lt;/End></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

refering to the start and end byte offsets for that particular result.

It is the responsibility of the programmer to already know or be able to

handle how many results there are in this <TT>RSet</TT> (like, knowing

what search generated the set). In <TT>{quieton raw}</TT> mode we get more

information about each region result:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&lt;Start>#&lt;/Start>&lt;End>#&lt;/End>&lt;Raw>&lt;Size>#&lt;/Size>blah

blah blah&lt;/Raw></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Start and End are byte offsets as before, but Size is the byte length of

the text delimited by the close Size tag and the close Raw tag.

<DT>

<TT>PSet</TT></DT>



<DD>

When a point set is printed, all the members of the set printed are surrounded

by a pair of <TT>PSet</TT> tags. In <TT>{quieton}</TT> mode, each result

from the point set consists of one tag:</DD>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;Start>#&lt;/Start></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where the surrounded number refers to a byte offset of the point. In <TT>{quieton

raw}</TT> mode, we get some more information:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&lt;Start>#&lt;/Start>&lt;Raw>&lt;Size>#&lt;/Size>flug

flug fluggy!&lt;/Raw></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Start is a byte offset, Size is a byte size, and the text of the point

is delimited by the close Size and close Raw. The dimensions of the text

printed depends on the combinations of the <TT>{printlength}</TT> and <TT>{leftcontext}</TT>

settings, or their explicit definition with the <TT>pr</TT> command involved.

<DT>

<A NAME="ERROR"></A><TT>Error</TT></DT>



<DD>

If some kind of non-fatal error occured during a search, XPat will, in

lieu of any of the preceding tags, send an error tag with some hopefully

helpful error message in it. The SSP CGI platform captures this, but doesn't

always do a great job of letting the programmer/user know, and the SSP

CGI platform always considers this fatal (ie, the CGI script tries to bail

out with a message whenever it gets this from XPat).</DD>

</DL>

<TT>{quietoff}</TT> is used to bring the interaction back into the normal

user interaction mode.

<BR>&nbsp;

<DT>

<TT>{printlength #}</TT></DT>



<DD>

This setting controls the default print window size for point sets, how

many total bytes are printed when a point set result is printed. See the

discussion of <TT>pr</TT> above. Default is 64.</DD>



<BR>&nbsp;

<DT>

<TT>{leftcontext #}</TT></DT>



<DD>

This setting controls how many characters before the matching text will

be printed when a point set is printed. If there are 100 characters of

<TT>{printlength}</TT>,

and 14 of <TT>{leftcontext}</TT>, then the point where the matching text

starts will be the 15th character. See the discussion of <TT>pr</TT> above.

Default is 14</DD>



<BR>&nbsp;

<DT>

<TT>{sortorder &lt;order>}</TT></DT>



<DD>

This determines in what order a given set of results is sorted by XPat.

I always use <TT>{sortorder occur}</TT>, but there are other modes.</DD>



<BR>&nbsp;

<DT>

<TT>{savefile "file"}</TT></DT>



<DD>

Changes the default save file name.</DD>



<BR>&nbsp;

<DT>

<TT>{exportfile "file"}</TT></DT>



<DD>

changes the default export file name.</DD>
