  </LI>
  <LI>Scope and overview: 
    <UL>
      <LI>Script installs the entire toolkit, including middleware for all classes, 
        plus the XPAT daemons </LI>
      <LI>Toolkit is installed with an appended version number, i.e., /foo/bar/dlxs-2.5 
        (where they supply /foo/bar/dlxs as the DLXSROOT and we tack on the -2.5) 
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Process: 
    <UL>
      <LI>gather general configuration information from user, based on choice 
        of components (try to preserve this information for a) re-running the 
        installation and maybe even b) future installs) 
        <UL>
          <LI>guess, ask for confirmation, and check platform and OS version </LI>
          <LI>guess, ask for confirmation, and check location and version of Perl 
            binary to use </LI>
          <LI>ask if this is a development or production installation </LI>
          <LI>ask for preferred database store (CSV, MySQL, Oracle) </LI>
          <LI>ask for and check writability of DLXS installation directory (DLXSROOT) 
          </LI>
          <LI>ask for and check location of Apache server root directory </LI>
          <LI>(optional) ask for and check location of tif2gif installation directory 
          </LI>
          <LI>(optional) ask for and check location of c42pdf installation directory 
          </LI>
          <LI>(optional) ask for and check location of Mr.Sid installation directory 
          </LI>

        </UL>
      </LI>
      <LI>check requirements 
        <UL>
          <LI>required Perl modules (make sure this reflects choice of database 
            store above) </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>
      <LI>extract and install deliverables 
        <UL>
          <LI>customize shebangs in Perl scripts--check all executable files (!) 
          </LI>
          <LI>customize configuration files as needed </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>
      <LI>supply an Apache configuration file snippet that creates a DLXS virtual 
        host with all required settings 
        <UL>
          <LI>definition of DLXSROOT environment variable </LI>
          <LI>definitions of AUTHZD_COLL and PUBLIC_COLL environment variables 
          </LI>
          <LI>definition of DLPS_DEV environment variable (make sure this reflects 
            choice of development or production above) </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>
      <LI>provide example scripts and configuration files that will need root 
        access for installation 
        <UL>
          <LI>crontab entries for cleaning gifcvtdir and sessions databases </LI>
          <LI>services and inetd.conf entries for installing XPAT daemons </LI>
          <LI>startup scripts to create /tmp-based directories with special permissions 
            (CSV databases) </LI>
          <LI>command to create non-/tmp-based directories with special permissions 
            (gifcvtdir) </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>
      <LI>offer to display late-breaking information (dynamically, driven from 
        contents of media) </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Remaining questions: 
    <UL>
      <LI>Where are all the places to make post-installation tweaks? Back then, 
        configuration files were not very well centralized, DLXSROOT was brand 
        new, Text Class was being born, and documentation was scant. Now we probably 
        have fewer places to make tweaks. What are they? </LI>
