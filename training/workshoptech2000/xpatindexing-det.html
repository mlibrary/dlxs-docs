<h3>

Indexing with XPat</h3>



<h4>

How To</h4>

See the information on <a href="dirstructure-gen.html" target="mainFrame">Directory

Structure</a> for information on how we recommend directories to be named

and set up.

<p>Once all the <a href="http://www.umdl.umich.edu/dlxs/training/workshop-user-2000.html" target="external">transformation

and preprocessing</a> is done, the finished, ready to index SGML is placed

in the proper <b><i>obj</i></b> directory.

<p>The collection's <a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile</a>

has variables that should be edited for the proper paths to the collection's

data, dtd, doctype, etc.

<ul>
  <li> <b><i><a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile</a></i></b>: 
    management of the normalization and indexing steps</li>
  <li> <b><i><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.blank.dd.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.blank.dd</a></i></b>: 
    This file is a skeleton of a data dictionary configuration. The Makefile copies 
    this "blank" or template file onto the corresponding <i><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.dd.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.dd</a></i> 
    which is then expanded during the actual indexing process.</li>
  <li> <b><i>coll.init</i></b>: This can conceivably contain any valid XPat command. 
    But this would mean that they would get loaded each time XPat is invoked. 
    Since most invocations are via a CGI script, we leave this empty. Unfortunately, 
    empty does not mean non-existent; it must be there. So, a zero length file 
    will do!</li>
  <li> <b><i><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.inp.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.inp</a> 
    (aka doctype)</i></b>: This file contains a <b>DOCTYPE</b> declaration; it 
    points to a <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.textclass.dtd.txt" target="sourcetext">dtd</a></b>, 
    which we also usually place in this directory although for some common dtds 
    which we place in the <b>lib</b> directory for access from many collections. 
    It may also contain other things, like entity references or APPINFO. <b>Note</b>: 
    Although with some difficulty, the older pat50 was able to use PUBLIC identifiers, 
    we find it much easier to use SYSTEM identifiers. The proper use of catalogs 
    may be an enhancement brougth to <b>XPat</b>.</li>
  <li> <b><i><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.extra.srch.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.extra.srch</a></i></b>: 
    used by <a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile</a> 
    to create <i>fabricated regions</i> <a href="#FabRegions">(see below)</a>.</li>
  <br>
  <p>These next files are created or modified by the XPat indexing process (<b>dbbuild50</b> 
    or its subprocesses) and the region indexing process<b><i>sgmlrgn50</i></b> 
    (which are part of the <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile</a></b> 
  <li> <b><i>coll.idx</i></b>: The actual index into the text. A binary file.</li>
  <li> <b><i>coll.rgn</i></b>: Another index into the file. This one is an index 
    into the regions (usually SGML) that exist in the file.</li>
  <li> <i><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.dd.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.dd</a></i><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.dd.txt">:</a> 
    This file contains:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> the specifications for the full paths to the text itself and the text 
      and region indexes.</li>
    <li> information about index points; that is, points in the stream of text 
      at which to start a "semi-infinite string".</li>
    <li> the specification of how characters are mapped to other characters when 
      receiving a user search term. You're allowed to map any character to any 
      other character. The &lt;Map> elements in the plain vanilla <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.blank.dd.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.blank.dd</a></b> 
      file account for case insensitivity, and for the mapping of punctuation 
      characters to spaces (so that word boundaries are recognized). Other mappings 
      are also possible.</li>
    <li> list of stopwords. We don't use these, since most of our text is literary 
      in nature, searching is also allowed on "the" and "of", etc.</li>
    <li><b>NOTE:</b> this file starts from the <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.blank.dd.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.blank.dd</a></b> 
      file but it is fleshed out after indexing. Interestingly, as you saw before, 
      this is a tagged ASCII text file and is therefore editable. That could be 
      dangerous, but it is also handy. Later for <a href="fabregions.html" target="mainFrame">fabricated 
      regions</a>.... </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> All of the pathnames and directories to which the <b>.dd</b> file 
  refers need to always exist, either real or symbolic. <b>XPat</b> has the interesting 
  feature that you could open up the <b>.dd</b> file and change directories and 
  filenames at whim (to suit whatever moving of largish files you need to do). 
  Sometimes, though a bit like cheating, it is easier to edit the paths after 
  moving text and/or index files than to reindex a large amount of text. 
  <li> The <b><i>idx</i></b> directory in which all these files live will also 
    serve as the scratch file space used by the indexing process, and as the permanent 
    home of all the index and region files made by <b>XPat</b>, all the fabricated 
    region files we make ourselves. The scratch file space is not to be overlooked 
    if you're tight on space: with a normal token definition and relatively simple 
    SGML, an indexing run will need between 150% and 175% of the space the final 
    index and region files take up.</li>
  <p>One way to index with XPat is with <b>dbbuild50</b>, which is a wrapper for 
    several other indexing subprocesses. We used to use <b>dbbuild50</b> or even 
    simply <b>patbld50</b> thusly: 
  <p><b><i>patbld50 -m 64m -D coll.dd</i></b> 
  <p>However, we have begun to standardize on more explicit invocations of the 
    subprocesses. See a typical <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile</a></b> 
    for an example of all the proper commands in order or check the printed <b>XPat</b> 
    documentation. <br>
    &nbsp; 
</ul>

The <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile</a></b>, 
while indexing, also runs the <b><i>sgmlrgn50</i></b> command. This gives us the 
all important index built on the regions declared in the DTD and allows searching 
within SGML regions.

  <h3> Indexing and Region Building: Hands On</h3>
  To get more of a feel for the process we'll use the bosnia Makefile to do the 
  above steps.&nbsp; Recall that prior to this step we did <a href="normalize.html">normalization</a> 
  (along with nodefy and validate steps). 
  <blockquote><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">% cd $HOME/dlxs/idx/b/bosnia</font></b> 
    <br>
    <b><font face="Courier New,Courier">% make dd</font></b>
</blockquote> 
  
      <hr width="100%">
      
<h4> What <i>dbbuild50 </i>(or its equivalent subprocesses) Gets Us</h4>
      What the <b>dd</b> step gets us depends almost entirely on what was in the 
<b><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.dd.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.dd</a></b> 
file: the <i>Index Points</i> and <i>Character Mappings</i>. The Index Points 
are descriptions of the type of text where where <b>XPat</b> will begin a semi-infinite 
string. The Mappings we usually use allow for case insensitivity and, in the case 
of some collections, for search mappings of 8 bit characters, e.g., thorns and 
eths. 
<p>We can now fire up the database we've just indexed successfully with: 
      <blockquote><b><i>pat50 coll.dd</i></b></blockquote>
      
<p>and <a href="query-gen.html" target="mainFrame">try some searching</a>. </p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p>After the <b><i><a href="rgnindexing.html" target="mainFrame">dd</a></i></b> 
  command, we continue with the <b><i>extra&nbsp; </i></b>make target. This is 
  a series of perl scripts that use the <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.extra.srch.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.extra.srch</a></b> 
  file, containing <b><i>export</i></b>-ed <b>XPat</b> searches, to create a bit 
  of text that is then added in the &lt;Regions> area of the <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.dd.txt">.dd</a></b> 
  file. In this way, <b>XPat</b> <b>.rgn</b> files (region indexes) will be created. 
  In the past, until we knew that we needed fabricated regions, we would usually 
  comment this out in the <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile</a></b>. 
  However, the new TextClass model requires them for regions like <i>page</i> 
  and <i>mainheader</i>.
<p>The <b><a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.extra.srch.txt" target="sourcetext">coll.extra.srch</a></b> 
  file contains the searches for all the fabricated regions we want to make. See 
  <a href="fabregions.html" target="mainFrame">fabricated regions</a>.

<h4>

For those of you who have used ot60, a note</h4>

It is here that <b><i>pat50</i></b> and <b><i>ot60</i></b> diverge significantly.

When <b><i>pat50</i></b> is reporting location information of points and

regions, it always refers to an absolute byte offset in the database. <b><i>ot60</i></b>

always refers to an absolute <i>token</i> offset in the database, or that

token at which the point or region begins. Unless the definition of token

is "any byte", then <b>tokens != bytes</b>. This did not normally affect

most systems' functionality: many of the SSP platform stunts can be done

either way, because they do not depend on absolute byte offset information.

But there are several stunts the XPat based cgi programs do that now can

and do assume bytes instead of token offsets.<i> Therefore, since from

now on we are dealing only with <b>pat50/XPat</b>, we needn't worry about

how <b>ot60</b> deals with token offset. Yay!</i>

<br>

<hr width="75%">

<p>By the way,some of those byte offset dependent stunts are:

<ul>

<li>

<b>Egregious Inline Markup</b></li>



<br>Briefly, sometimes we want to be able to provide phrase searching but

are hindered by copious markup. Under <i>XPat</i> we have been known to

do the following: make a mirror database that has whitespace substituted

in for the "egregious" markup in question.

<li>

<b>Ordering Results</b></li>



<br>As shall be seen in the CGI programs, there is a lot of the DLPS platform

that depends on the offset order of results as they are returned from XPat.</ul>

<b>Aside</b>: one rather interesting bit of functionality that is more

easily accomplished with token-based <b>ot60</b> than with byte-offset-based

<b>pat50</b>

is some of the interesting context and ordering performed in the <b><a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/micase/" target="external">MiCASE</a></b>

collection.

<br>

<hr width="75%">

<p>After the sgmlrgn50 target and the optional post target for fabricated

regions, depending on the collection, the <b><i>Makefile</i></b> may continue

with the <a href="makefile-gen.html" target="mainFrame">pageview and/or

the wordwheel steps</a>.
