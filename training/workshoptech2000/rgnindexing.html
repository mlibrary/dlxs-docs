    <h3>The <b>sgmlrgn</b> Step</h3>

    
<p>The <b>sgmlrgn50</b> command creates a coll.rgn file, an index into every SGML 
  region in the text.</p>
<p>The command, outside the Makefile, would look like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      
  <pre>sgmlrgn50 -m region -o /dir/coll -D /dir/coll.dd doctype coll.sgm</pre>
</blockquote>

    
<p>where the <b>-m region</b> tells <b>sgmlrgn50</b> that it is building regions, 
  the <b>-o <i>directory</i></b> tells it where the output file should go, the 
  <b>-D ddfile</b> tells it what <b>.dd</b> file to use. The next argument is 
  the <b><b>doctype</b></b> file to use (usually <b>collname.inp</b>, and the 
  last argument is the sgml data file. </p>

    <h4><a name="sgmlrgn">What <b>sgmlrgn50</b> Gets Us</a></h4>

    <p>The <b>sgmlrgn</b> step identifies main SGML <em>elements</em>
      and constructs them as <em>regions</em>.  To make things as precise
      as possible:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>an <em>element</em> is a formal sgml construct in the DTD,
        identifying part of the logical structure of a document, and
        physically represented by a start and end tag.</li>

      <li>a <em>region</em> is some span of text in a pat50 database,
        identified by its start and end byte offsets.</li>

      <li>an <em>sgml region</em> is a region that often
        <strong>coincides</strong> with some aspect of an
        <em>element</em>.</li>

      
  <li>a <em>fabricated region</em> is a region that we've specified ourselves 
	somehow, not generated directly or in whole by <b>sgmlrgn</b> (this is a 
	DLPS term).</li>

    </ul>


    <p>What elements we have is determined by our use of the DTD.
      What sgml regions we have is determined by the DTD:
      <b>sgmlrgn</b> makes the following regions for us
      automatically:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><strong>ELEMENT</strong></b> a region for each element
      declared in the DTD (whether or not it is used in the document
      instances!).  This begins at the STAGO of the start tag, and
      ends at the <em>last non-word character after the
      ETAGO of the end tag</em>.  The name of the region is the same
      as the generic identifier for the element, in uppercase.</li>

      <li><b><strong>ELEMENT-T</strong></b> a region for the start
        tag of each element <em>used in the document</em>.  This
        begins at the STAGO of the start tag, and ends at the <em>last
        non-word character after the ETAGO of the start
        tag</em>.  The name of the region is the name of the generic
        identifier of the element in uppercase followed by '-T'.</li>

      
  <li><b><strong>A-ATTRIB</strong></b> a region for each attribute used in the 
	document (and oddly enough, where their elements appear, they are always considered 
	to have been used, so there are always members (but possibly null strings) 
	in these regions!). This begins with the first significant character of the 
	attribute value itself, and continues to the <em>last non-word character after 
	the formal end of the attribute value</em>. The name of the region is the 
	attribute name in uppercase, preceded by a 'A-'. Attributes declared with 
	the same name in different elements are in the same region.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, if we had a proper SGML database of some HTML documents, we
      would have sgml regions like the following:</p>

    <blockquote><b>HTML<br>
      P<br>
      STRONG<br>
      META-T<br>
      INPUT-T<br>
      A-HREF<br>
      A-NAME<br>
      A-ALT<br>
      </b></blockquote>

    <p>For empty elements, those elements that have a start tag, and
      no content or end tag (say, IMG or BR), region ELEMENT and
      region "ELEMENT-T" are congruent.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> regions whose names have
      characters other than [A-Za-z0-9] in them <em>must</em> be
      double-quoted to be interpreted by pat50 correctly.  All the
      A-ATTRIB and ELEMENT-T regions must be so quoted, as must things
      like TEI.2.  Fine argument for always double-quoting region
      names.</blockquote>

    <p>We can print out a list of all currently defined regions with
      the fabulously useful <b>{ddinfo regionnames}</b> command:</p>

    <blockquote>
  <pre>&gt;&gt; {ddinfo regionnames}
HTML-T [ ]
HEAD-T [ ]
TITLE-T [ ]
TITLE [ ]
A-NAME [ ]
A-CONTENT [ ]
META-T [ ]
META [ ]
HEAD [ ]
A-BGCOLOR [ ]
BODY-T [ ]
A-ALIGN [ ]
...
DIV-T [ ]
H3-T [ ]
H3 [ ]
DIV [ ]
A-SRC [ ]
A-ALT [ ]
IMG-T [ ]
IMG [ ]
BR-T [ ]
BR [ ]
&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <p>The [ ] would usually hold some user-defined descriptive or
      annotative text about the region under PAT50 (say, how or why it
      was made by whom, especially important for fabricated regions), viz.:</p>

    <blockquote>
  <pre>
    &lt;Region&gt;
      &lt;Name&gt;A-OTHERSOURCE&lt;/Name&gt;
      &lt;Desc&gt;attribute describing the other source...&lt;/Desc&gt;
      &lt;File&gt;
        &lt;SysName&gt;/home/pagliere/dlxs/idx/t/text/main.rgn&lt;/SysName&gt;
        &lt;ModDate&gt;898201323&lt;/ModDate&gt;
        &lt;Offset&gt;2279824&lt;/Offset&gt;
      &lt;/File&gt;
      &lt;Count&gt;4240&lt;/Count&gt;
      &lt;Type&gt;pairs&lt;/Type&gt;
    &lt;/Region&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

    
<p>Which renders in XPat in a <b>{ddinfo regionnames}</b> command as:</p>

    <blockquote><pre>
A-OTHERSOURCE [attribute describing the other source...]
</pre></blockquote>

    
<p>We've never actually used this. We're not even sure there is a reason for using 
  this. </p>

    
<p><b>{ddinfo regionnames}</b> not only lists the sgml regions defined, but 
  also any <a href="fabrgns.html">fabricated regions</a>. </p>
