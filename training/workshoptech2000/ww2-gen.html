Wordwheel Program Overview and Data Preparation</h2>
<a href="http://dev.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/ww2-idx?c=bosnia&page=wwstart">Wordwheel</a>
is the name we give to a browsing capability available in TextClass for
a given collection or across multiple collections.
<p>If the user enters a word or word-beginning, wordwheel presents the
user with a list of all words that appear in a collection together with
the number of occurrences.&nbsp; The user can select from the list and
perform a simple search on the selected words.
<p>The CGI that implements this functionality is discussed later in Program
Architecture - <a href="ww2-idx.html">ww2-idx</a>
<p>Here we discuss the creation of the <b><i>data</i></b> which supports
the wordwheel for a given collection
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
History</h3>
Previously implemented as a shell script that found words in the collection
SGML and partitioned the result into files words_A through words_Z.&nbsp;
The CGI then executed a grep using the user's input as a pattern over one
or more of these files and extracted a window of lines around the match.&nbsp;
Problems were slowness, difficulty of cross collection searching, extraction
of windows spanning files.

<h3>
Overview of wordwheel data creation</h3>
We first run <a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.ww.txt" target="sourcetext">Makefile
for WW</a> which runs <a href="sourcetext/idx/makeWordWheelFiles.pl.txt" target="sourcetext">makeWordWheelFiles.pl</a>to
create wordwheel derived SGML.&nbsp; This makefile has mostly the same
targets as that for indexing the sgml for collections.&nbsp; It does not
create fabricated regions -- they have no use in wordwheel.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Work with Content Specialist / encoders on realms</h3>
Looking at the <a href="sourcetext/makeWordWheelFiles.cfg.txt">makeWordWheelFIles.cfg</a>
file note that what are called <b><i>realms </i></b>must be defined for
each collection.&nbsp; We work with the content specialist to determine
what region definitions best define the realms in question for a given
collection.<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b> A <b><i>realm</i></b> is a region in the
collection SGML from which we would like to extract words.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
The <a href="sourcetext/bin/makeWordWheelFiles.pl.txt">makeWordWheelFiles.pl</a>
Program</h3>
<b>makeWordWheelFiles.pl</b> reads realm definitions from the <a href="sourcetext/makeWordWheelFiles.cfg.txt">makeWordWheelFIles.cfg</a>&nbsp;
file and constructs XPat queries against the collection SGML . Note therefore
that the collection must already be indexed before we can make the Wordwheel
data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; makeWordWheelFiles.pl<b> </b>takes the query results
and processes them into individual word of interest, stores the word and
keeps a count of occurances.&nbsp; It wraps each word in and &lt;E> tag
and sets the N, O and L (more later on these) attributes.&nbsp; Words are
further categorized into alpha, numeric and other.&nbsp; A higher level
tag, e.g. &lt;ALPHA> wraps the word tag.&nbsp; Finally the&lt; REALMNAME>
tag is added and all are wrapped by a &lt;REALM> tag.&nbsp; We can see
this in the <a href="sourcetext/wordwheel.dtd.txt">wordwheel.dtd.</a>
<p>Here is an SGML fragment:
<p><tt>&lt;REALM></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; &lt;REALMNAME>full text&lt;/REALMNAME></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ALPHA></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;E N="0" O="8205"
L="a">a &lt;/E></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;E N="1" O="1690"
L="a">&agrave; &lt;/E></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;E N="2" O="1" L="a'district">a'district
&lt;/E></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;E N="3" O="1" L="a-piece">a-piece
&lt;/E></tt>
<p><tt>After the Wordwheel SGML is created it is normalized and indexed
using the same commands as for the collection SGML itself as described
in<a href="xpatindexing-det.html"> XPat Indexing</a>.</tt>
<p><tt>A word about the <b>L</b> attribute.&nbsp; L is short for LEMMA.&nbsp;
This attribute is used to store 8 bit characters as their 7 bit equivalent
so that<b> &agrave; </b>is stored as <b>a</b>.&nbsp; This feature allows
the wordwheel CGI (<a href="sourcetext/cgi/ww2-idx.txt">ww2-idx</a>) to
build cross-collection wordwheels sorted alphabetically across multiple
collections that may span multiple languages.&nbsp; Otherwise <b>&agrave;
</b>would sort after<b> z.&nbsp; </b>The flag for this to happen is the
$gLocale variable in </tt><a href="sourcetext/makeWordWheelFiles.cfg.txt">makeWordWheelFIles.cfg.</a>&nbsp;
If $gLocale is set to other than 'c', lemma attributes are created.<b><tt></tt></b>

<h4>
Make Wordwheel Data: Hands On</h4>
To get more of a feel for the process we'll use the bosnia Wordwheel Makefile
to make the Wordwheel SGML, normalize the SGML and then index it.&nbsp;
Earlier in the workshop we edited the correct paths into makeWordWheelFiles.cfg
which is the input to makeWordWheelFIles.pl which is invoked by the first
target.
