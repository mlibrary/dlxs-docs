    <h3>Creating Fabricated Regions</h3>

    
<p>Throughout the documents and discussion so far, we've avoided going into depth 
  about the concept of fabricated regions, using it but not explaining it on purpose. 
  The things included in the <b>extra</b> target of the <a href="makefile-gen.html" target="mainFrame">Makefile</a> 
  perform the steps needed to create a set of regions according to a qualification 
  or from-here-to-there argument. </p>

    <hr width="50%">

    <h4>What's a Fabricated Region and Why Do We Care?</h4>

    
<p>As the DLPS platform uses the phrase, a <i>fabricated region</i> is some span 
  of text in an indexed document not well or exactly defined by the SGML region 
  distinctions from <b>sgmlrgn</b>, but requires some extra decision-making. 
  These fabricated regions exist as conveniences for speeding up searching and 
  displaying meaningful results of a search.</p>

    <p>For the <strong>speeding up searches convenience</strong>,
      consider an SGML DTD that describes books, using a <tt>DIV</tt>
      element to describe large divisions in the text like chapters,
      prefaces, appendices, and the like.  To distinguish different
      <tt>DIV</tt>s from each other, it has a <tt>TYPE</tt> attribute
      that takes CDATA.  If a given collection of books marked-up with
      this DTD all use a <tt>DIV TYPE="ABSTRACT"</tt> tag to surround
      the abstract of a book, and we know that we will want to allow
      searches in the abstracts often, we might want to define a
      fabricated region for all the abstracts of the books, so that
      "<tt>region abstract</tt>" would be something we could simply
      refer to (and find out about with <tt>{ddinfo regionnames}</tt>),
      rather than having to compute <tt>region DIV incl
      "type=abstract"</tt> each time we wanted to refer to
      abstracts.
      </p>

    
<p>For the <strong>displaying meaningful results convenience</strong>, consider 
  an SGML DTD that permits deep hierarchy, and a collection of documents that 
  make extensive use of that deep hierarchy. Just about any <i>Chadwyck-Healey</i> 
  literature collection you can think of (especially poetry databases) permit 
  the arbitrary nesting of DIV-like elements, and then frequently use this nesting 
  ability quite a bit. One of the HTI/DLPS philosophies is to try to provide as 
  much useful context to the user as possible, and in the case of such a possibly 
  deep hierarchy, one take on context is to show as much of the hierarchy as possible 
  when displaying results. We might want search matches to be displayed along 
  with their structural or logical parents, and some indication of just what those 
  parents are. </p>

    <p>To further complicate this, the <tt>DIV</tt>s that nest might
    have a couple of different ways that we could identify them with
    text meaningful to the user.  We might see in the mark-up:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>&lt;DIV ID="347"&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;Chapter the 9th: "Hiya Toots!"&lt;/HEAD&gt;</tt></blockquote>

    <p>But at the same time:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>&lt;DIV ID="15.a" TYPE="chapter" NUM="13"&gt;</tt></blockquote>

    
<p>These both have some identification information on them, but in different ways: 
  the first example has a nice HEAD element, whose contents are inscrutable to 
  the program, but which we know represent the title of this section. The second 
  has no HEAD element, but has a TYPE and NUM attribute for some intelligible, 
  human understandable title information. We'd like to make a fabricated region 
  that would capture all the "title" type information for each DIV, regardless 
  of what kind of DIV it is (we also don't have to recompute it each time; it 
  will be indexed like any other region.) </p>

    <p>When analysing the documents, and thinking about what kinds of
      searching and retrieval we want to do on them, we might come up
      with these kinds of distinctions that we'll want to make often
      and conveniently.  We then consider defining some fabricated
      regions.</p>

    <hr width="50%">

    <h4><tt>region</tt> and Qualification</h4>

    <p>These forms of the command are the simplest, in fact we've used
      them already:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>region A + region B<br>
        region A - region B<br>
        region A ^ region B<br>
        (point set) - region B<br>
        (point set) ^ region B<br>
        region A - (point set)<br>
        region A ^ (point set)<br>
        region A incl (point or region set)<br>
        region A within region B<br>
        region A fby (point or region set)<br>
        region A near (point or region set)</tt></blockquote>

    
<p>The above will always evaluate to new region sets.<br>
  <!--
With the exceptions of the +, ^, and - expressions, all the members of the new 
  region set will also be members of the first region expression. <br>
  In the + expression, all members (with the overlapping and nesting caveats) 
  of the individual regions will be present. <br>
  In - and ^ expressions only involving regions, members of the new result set 
  will all be members of the region set with the shortest lengthwise members (if 
  this sounds like a fuzzy distinction, that's because it is from our experience...).
-->
</p>
<hr width="50%">

    <h4><tt>region</tt> and From-Here-To-There</h4>


    <p>The <tt>region</tt> command:</p>

    <blockquote><tt>region <em>&lt;from&gt;</em> .. <em>&lt;to&gt;</em></tt></blockquote>

    <p>takes a valid point expression in the
    <strong>&lt;from&gt;</strong>, and some valid point 
    expression as the <strong>&lt;to&gt;</strong>.  It will compute
    the resulting regions set as all those spans of text starting at
    the start offset of each <strong>&lt;from&gt;</strong>s, to
    and including the start offset of the nearest following
    <strong>&lt;to&gt;</strong>, with no other
    <strong>&lt;from&gt;</strong> intervening.  Anytime a
    <strong>&lt;from&gt;</strong> has no following
    <strong>&lt;to&gt;</strong>, either because there are none further
    in the text, or they are all already claimed by some other
    <strong>&lt;from&gt;</strong>, un-mated
    <strong>&lt;from&gt;</strong> doesn't appear in the resulting
    region set.  None of the result regions will overlap.  For
    instance, in an HTML database we might:</p>

    <blockquote><pre>&gt;&gt; region A
  5: 50 matches
&gt;&gt; region BR
  6: 5 matches
&gt;&gt; region "A-T" .. "&lt;BR&gt;"
  7: 2 matches
&gt;&gt; </pre></blockquote>

    <p>Each of the members in 7 starts with the start tag of an A
      element, and runs up to the next BR element (we get at the BR
      element in a back-handed way...), without another A start tag
      intervening.  Because of the way the BR and A elements fall in
      this HTML, it can only make two such regions.</p>

<!--
    <p>The query language reference guide for ot60 leads us to think
      we can have the <strong><from></strong> be any kind of <em>point
    or region expression</em>.  To try the same example as above with a
    point set for the A element start tag, how about:</p>

    <blockquote><pre>>> region "<A" .. "<BR>"
  9: no match
[ENUS][Message #:298] Not a data dictionary defined region
>> </pre></blockquote>

    <p>Hard telling what the problem here is.  My thought is that the
      command interpreter flunks us here because for some reason it
      isn't checking against all possibilities for the <tt>region</tt>
      command.  In any event, if we've had some regions created for us
      already, either by the <a href="sgmlrgn.html"><tt>sgmlrgn</tt>
      step</a> or in the <a
      href="sgmlrgn.html#otbldrgn"><tt>otbld</tt> step</a>, we can
      satisfy the requirements of the <tt>region</tt> command as it
      is.</p>

    <p>PAT50 on the other hand, can behave as the ot60 documentation
    would lead us to think ot60 can behave.</p>

<h4>Fabricated Region Examples </h4>

    
<dl> 
  <dt><em>I need to reserve all the abstracts for fast searching</em> We need 
    to know the DTD and usage details as above.</dt>
  <dd> 
    <blockquote> 
      <pre>&gt;&gt; region DIV incl "type=abstract"
  1: 15 matches
&gt;&gt; region DIV incl (region "DIV-T" incl "type=abstract")
  2: 12 matches
&gt;&gt; </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These examples are given in the order of increasing paranoia. The difference 
      between first and the last has to do with whether or not strings matching 
      "type=abstract" can occur in more than one kind of place in a DIV (like, 
      as an attribute on a sub element of a DIV). </p>

  <h4>Exporting a Fabricated Region and Using it in the Index</h4>

<p><i>This example taken from the <a href="sourcetext/idx/bosnia.extra.srch.txt" target="sourcetext">bosnia.extra.srch</a> 
  file. I want a region that represents a head of a DIV1. I need to find all DIV1s 
  that have a HEAD. But since there are some DIV1s that do not have HEAD regions, 
  for those DIV1s I need to get the DIV1 tag itself. I must remember during all 
  this that the HEAD regions in question must be ones at the DIV1 level, not inside 
  sub-DIVs.... </i></p>

    
<blockquote> 
  <pre>&gt;&gt; ((region "&lt;DIV1".."&lt;/HEAD>") ^ (region DIV1 incl (region HEAD not within region DIV2)))
 1: 101 matches
&gt;&gt; ((region "DIV1-T") ^ (region DIV1 not incl (region HEAD not within region DIV2)))
 2: 12 matches

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

    <p>Once we've constructed a search that identifies the regions
      that we care about, we <tt>export</tt> that region to a file,
      and incorporate that file into the main index, so that the
      region we've identified is loaded when the database is run:</p>

    <blockquote>
  <pre>&gt;&gt; 1 + 2
 3: 113 matches
&gt;&gt; {exportfile "./div1headtest.rgn"}
&gt;&gt; export
&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
</blockquote>

    
<p>Now there is a new file <i><b>./div1headtest.rgn</b></i> that is a binary index 
  file of this new 'virtual' region. We can make <b>XPat</b> aware of it by adding 
  it to the <b>Regions</b> area of the <tt><b>.dd</b></tt> file. </p>

<p>The <a href="sourcetext/idx/Makefile.bosnia.txt" target="sourcetext"><b>Makefile</b></a> 
  contains a command which takes commands like these and uses them to create a 
  <b>.rgn</b> file and a text file <b>coll.extra.dd</b> which is then incorporated 
  into the main <b>.dd</b> file with the<a href="sourcetext/bin/inc.extra.dd.pl.txt" target="sourcetext"> 
  <b>inc.extra.pl</b></a> perl script.</p>

<p>We can then refer to the fabricated region with "region div1headtest", and 
  see "div1headtext" as one of the available regions from <b>{ddinfo regionnames}</b>.</p>
