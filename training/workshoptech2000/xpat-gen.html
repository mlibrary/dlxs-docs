XPat Overview</h3>



<h4>

History</h4>

Until 1998, most DLPS middleware was built using the OpenText search engine, version 
5.0, aka <b>pat50</b>. The indexes <b>pat50</b> builds is based on a structure 
called a <b>Patricia Tree</b> which analyzes substrings of the entire text which 
are known as <b>semi-infinite strings</b> or <b>sisstrings</b>. For more information 
on these check: 
<blockquote><b><i>Information Retrieval: Data Structures and Algorithms</i></b>

<br>W. B. Frakes and R. S. Baeza-Yates

<br>1992.

<br><i></i>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<i>Sistrings</i> as you'll see them in the literature, have some interesting

properties:

<blockquote>

<li>

They start at some offset in the entire string of the database</li>



<li>

They stretch off to at least the end of the database (implying that they

<i>always</i>

overlap with each other...)</li>



<li>

One can change (with the <b>IndexPts</b> section of the pat50 <b>.dd</b>

file) where they start</li>

</blockquote>



<p><br>One of the most important features of <b>pat50/XPat</b> is its ability

to index not only full text, but also to index SGML regions. This gives

the ability to create complex searches that reach into regions of text

based on the markup elements.

<p>In 1998 and 1999 we began to use the next generation of OpenText search

engine, <b>ot60</b>, which builds indexes on tokens rather than sistrings.

However, we much prefered the Pat tree structure and some of its features.

<p>Happily, DLPS was able, in 1999, to acquire the source code to <b>pat50</b>

(see <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/reorg-letter.html" target="external">pat50/DLPS

recent developments</a>), which OpenText was no longer supporting. We can

now offer a license to use our version of the original engine, now being

called <b>XPat</b>. We have already begun to make changes to it and will

continue to do so. These enhancements include:

<ul>

<li>

update region indexing to use nsgmls, rather than the older sgmls</li>



<li>

allow indexing of XML</li>



<li>

allow for the use of Unicode in marked up text</li>



<li>

build in knowledge of SGML/XML element ancestry; perhaps use the DOM</li>



<li>

allow for ability to be aware and ignore, as needed, markup which may intervene

in strings of text being searched</li>

</ul>
