<H3>Humanities SGML Server Offering</H3>
</CENTER>

The following is intended as a basis for discussions.  Negotiated 
terms will result in a license, prepared by the University of 
Michigan

<H4>Initial Audience</H4>
The capability described here will be limited, initially, to no 
more than ten institutions.   If ten or more CIC institutions 
choose to participate, the University of Michigan will determine a 
way to accommodate all interested institutions.  The University of 
Michigan will monitor performance and add institutions within the 
bounds of acceptable performance levels.  Prior to April 1st 
preference will be given to CIC institutions.  In addition to the 
initial ten institutions, smaller colleges and universities may be 
added by the University of Michigan in a service model that 
provides access to data resources, but not additional benefits 
(e.g., tailoring search capabilities) described here.

<H4>Initial Offerings</H4>
The University of Michigan will offer the following resources in 
the initial release:

<OL>
<LI>English Poetry Database</LI>
<LI>Patrologia Latina Database</LI>
<LI>African-American Verse Database</LI>
<LI>English Verse Drama</LI>
<LI>American Poetry Database </LI>
</OL>


Each institution must have a valid license for the collection(s) 
to which we provide access.  Each institution will be 
responsible for negotiating licenses with Chadwyck-Healey and 
Oxford University Press.  Access will be "turned on" only for 
collections which the participating institution has licensed.  The 
University of Michigan can differentiate access by institution.

<H4>Additional Collections</H4>
The University of Michigan reserves the right to add other 
databases without additional charges at its own discretion.  New 
databases or collections may be proposed by participating 
institutions.  If the University of Michigan determines that 
mounting the databases is feasible, it will determine cost based 
on the cost of data preparation, disk space, and projected server 
upgrades needed to support additional use.

<H4>Service and training</H4>
The University of Michigan will provide each participating 
institution training on-site at the University of Michigan.  
Institutions will be responsible for covering the cost of sending 
designated training, support, and systems staff to Ann Arbor for 
training, and for coordinating dates for scheduling training with 
the University of Michigan.  Each institution will tailor WWW 
search interfaces and support documents to its institution's 
requirements and will make clear on these forms that public 
service support is provided by the participating institution.  The 
University of Michigan will demonstrate and explicate server-end 
access mechanisms for systems staff, as desired, in order to help 
tailor search mechanisms to the needs determined by the 
participating institution.  Data on use by each participating 
institution will be provided to the institution by the University 
of Michigan.

<H4>Customizing system capabilities</H4>
The University of Michigan will work with participating 
institutions to assess desired system capabilities.  To the extent 
that these capabilities are supported by the software and can be 
implemented within the bounds of the resources available for the 
service (determined by the University of Michigan), new 
capabilities will be written into server code.  After 
negotiations, if the University of Michigan determine that this 
capability is offered by the search engine and that the 
programming is within the scope of resources for the project, this 
capability will be written into server-side code, and the 
University of Michigan will work with the participating university 
to help design an appropriate form for users at that institution.

<H4>Security</H4>
Initially, access to the databases will rely on the Internet 
domain of the client computers.  The University of Michigan will 
restrict access to the retrieval routines by listing, on the 
server, valid Internet addresses at the participating 
institutions.  The participating institution will be responsible 
for negotiating appropriate licensing to allow this mode of 
restriction; the University of Michigan will assist, as 
appropriate, in conveying an understanding of these capabilities 
to Chadwyck-Healey and Oxford University Press.  The University of 
Michigan will continue to work to achieve more vigilant access 
mechanisms, including client/server password restrictions based on 
such technologies as Kerberos.   The participating institution 
will be responsible for monitoring local use and identifying 
breaches or leaks (e.g., an unrestricted public server that 
provides access through Lynx) and communicating the Internet 
address(es) of these machines to the University of Michigan.  
Ideally, the participating institution will provide the University 
of Michigan with a completed access restriction file in the NCSA 
format.

<H4>Sharing infrastructure</H4>
The University of Michigan will make available to each 
participating institution the primary access tools (compiled 
programs or code) developed by the University of Michigan.  
Participating institutions may, at their discretion, use these 
tools to implement parallel systems.  Continued participation in 
the consortium (based on continued payment of fees) will entitle 
institutions who implement local systems to these same resources 
in an ongoing basis.  The University of Michigan has made a 
significant investment in building these access mechanisms.  Code 
made available to the participating institution must not be shared 
with other institutions, except with the permission of the 
University of Michigan.  Services built around the code must be 
limited to providing access at the participating university and 
providing free Internet access to other collections; the code must 
not be used to develop a competitive fee-based service; using
the code to provide service for multiple institutions (e.g., consortia) must be 
negotiated separately.

<H4>Cost</H4>
License fees for collections are not included in the following 
cost model; licenses must be negotiated between individual institutions and the publisher.  
The cost model the University of Michigan has developed represents 
incremental costs for moving to production, along with development 
costs that can be shared by the participating institutions.  The 
preliminary costs are based on a ten institution model.  Annual fees do not 
pay for infrastructure (i.e., hardware and purchased software).  
The costs presented here are for a fixed two year commitment and 
are negotiable after that point.  Institutions interested only in 
the code may participate for the ongoing annual fees (i.e., 
as a "local" institution), subject to the limitations noted above 
in Sharing Infrastructure.


<H4>Expansion of Participating Institutions</H4>
The University of Michigan will monitor system performance to 
determine the extent to which system capabilities are available to 
add new institutions.  Should system performance and staff 
availability be adequate, the University of Michigan will add 
institutions at a rate commensurate with ongoing assessment and 
ensured levels of quality performance.
