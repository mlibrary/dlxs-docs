<B>American Poetry online</B>
<P>
Last week we received the American Poetry Database.  Because of
similarities with other Chadwyck-Healey collections, the development
time has been fairly short.  Beginning next week, we will have
a beta version available at:
<P>
 <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/english/ampo/">http://www.hti.umich.edu/english/ampo/</A>
<P>
For those institutions accessing collections on www.hti.umich.edu,
please feel free to circulate the URL and begin testing.  Your
feedback is appreciated.  A production version should be available
by mid-January.  <BR>
<P>
For institutions accessing the collection on a server at their
home institution, we will begin distribution of the built indexes,
interface, and middleware in late January.  Again, for institutions
mounting locally, please make sure that we have a letter on file
from Chadwyck-Healey confirming your license if you wish to mount
the collection locally.  To date, we have letters for Indiana/IUPUI,
and Rice.<BR>
<P>
<B>New server<BR>
</B>The new server has arrived and we have completed installation
and testing.  Beginning tomorrow, the address www.hti.umich.edu
will migrate from the current machine to the new server.  Performance
should improve significantly, both on the server and with regard
to bandwidth.  The new machine has several times the capacity/performance
of the current machine, and is attached directly to the campus
fiber (FDDI) backbone.  Because it also uses a different operating
system, we may see some peculiarities in IP-name resolution, and
consequently some new issues with access restrictions.  Please
bear with us as we resolve these.  Working through your systems/technical
representative will help us to better track valid numeric addresses
and resolve problems quickly.<BR>
<P>
<B>Contacts list</B>
<P>
We have posted a list of campus contacts on the SGML Server Program
web space:
<P>
 <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/contacts.html">http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/contacts.html</A>
<P>
Please review the list and contact me with corrections and additions.
 I hope you will encourage staff to work through the contacts
in reporting problems and raising questions.  It will help us
in a number of ways, not least of which reducing the number of
times we answer a question.  In particular, it will be helpful
in resolving problems of access restrictions.  To help you comply
with the terms of the Chadwyck-Healey and OUP licenses (i.e.,
by restricting access to valid subnets), we need to be sure that
the person reporting a purportedly valid IP address is providing
accurate information.  It will also help the Technical/Systems
contact person to build and keep a complete listing for future
work.<BR>

<B>Summer workshop</B>
<P>
As part of the SGML Server Program, you are all invited to come
to Ann Arbor for training in several aspects of support for the
text resources.  We have begun planning for two summer workshops,
to be offered in conjunction with the School of Information. 
Tentative plans are for the first to be workshop to be held from
May 27<SUP>th</SUP>-31<SUP>st</SUP>, with the SSP-specific portion
to be offered on the final two days (Friday and Saturday).  SGML
Server Program participants are invited to send two persons to
the SSP portion of the workshop at no charge for the workshop.
 The first three days will cover SGML encoding (use of Author/Editor),
scanning/OCR, and several related topics.  The fee for the week-long
workshop will be set later.  We have been able to negotiate a
50% rate for SSP participants for the week-long workshop, so that
it will be possible to attend the final two days at no charge,
or the entire week at a lesser rate.  More information will follow
as we firm up details. <BR>
