<P>
The SGML Server Program (SSP) at the University of Michigan has
been created to provide online support for selected SGML-encoded
text and reference collections to other academic institutions.
 Operated by staff in the Humanities Text Initiative, the SSP
has been designed to leverage Michigan's years of experience in
this area to assist in the development of SGML support in libraries.
 The Program provides services in two major areas:  on-site at
Michigan (&quot;remote service&quot;) and off-site at the participating
institution (&quot;local service&quot;).  A number of documents, online at <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/">http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/</A>, provide
detailed information about the SGML Server Program, licensing,
and resources.  This document is intended as an overview of the
program and its resources.

<H3>What is provided?</H3>
The SSP provides participating institutions with the following:
<OL>
<LI>&quot;middleware&quot;:  The SSP provides software, developed
by the HTI, for providing access to Web-based SGML collections.
 This middleware is tailored to each of the collections.  The
principal collections are described in the <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/pdd.html">Preliminary Discussion Document</A>.
 A rigorous process of development and testing is employed.  Middleware
is first tested by University of Michigan SSP staff and users.
 Subsequently, it is deployed for &quot;remote service&quot; users
for a period of approximately one month.  After this period, the
middleware is deployed at &quot;local service&quot; institutions.
<LI>processed SGML:  materials that are received from the publisher
are typically processed to ensure validity and to &quot;normalize&quot;
SGML to provide easier handling of the documents.  To the extent
that materials do <I>not</I> validate, the SSP undertakes to document
and negotiate fixes from the publisher, or fix these problems
if this cannot be negotiated.
<LI>built indexes:  The indexing process with OpenText tools is
relatively straightforward, but involves a degree of decision-making
based on detailed document analysis.  The SSP provides participants
with both primary word/phrase level indexing, and &quot;special
region&quot; indexing, where complex but central SGML structures
are identified.
</OL>

<P>
In addition, the SSP provides participating institutions with
the following support:
<OL>
<LI>installation:  SSP staff will install collections and middleware
on the server of the participating institution.  For &quot;remote
service&quot; institutions, this may not be necessary or desired,
as the collections will be provided on a server at the University
of Michigan.  For institutions with security restrictions that
do not permit a local login by SSP staff, the SSP will provide
tapes.
<LI>ongoing development and &quot;fixes&quot;:  As long as the
institution participates in the SSP, new mechanisms and fixes
for current mechanisms will be provided.
<LI>training:  At least one time per year, the SSP staff will
host a training session at the University of Michigan.  Participating
institutions will be invited to send two representatives (preferably
a public service representative and a systems representative)
to explore support for the resources and, for systems staff, to
explore the design of the middleware.
<LI>documentation:  The SSP will endeavor to develop and extend
online documentation.  
<LI>online support:  Each participating institution will designate
as many as three representatives, one each for public service,
collection development, and technical issues.  Staff at the participating
institutions will be expected to work through these representatives
to resolve problems with the online resources.  The SSP will work
with these representatives to provide immediate resolution of
problems.  Users at the participating institutions should be directed
to local public service and collection development staff.
</OL>


<H3>User Agreement and related documents</H3>
A <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/ssp.pdf">user agreement</A> is
provided online. The agreement must be signed by participating
institutions and returned to <A HREF="http://web500gw.itd.umich.edu:8888/So%3dUniversity%20of%20Michigan%2c%20c%3dUS?S=sharyn.sivyer">Sharyn Sivyer</A> 
at DRDA, with a copy to John Price-Wilkin (302 Hatcher North,
Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1205).  The user agreement provides the general
terms of the agreement between the participating institution and
the SGML Server Program.  Reference is made (in the user agreement)
to a <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/pdd.html">Preliminary Discussion Document</A>, 
which provides further details on the scope and nature of the
service.  A <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/requirements.html">third document on requirements</A> in
the program lays out, in greater detail, the technical and contractual
requirements (e.g., between the institution and Oxford University
Press) for participation.

<H3>Costs</H3>
Costs for participation in the SGML Server Program are differentiated
by remote and local access.  These costs will change as we develop
a better sense of the demand for the service and the amount of
support needed for both local and remote institutions.  These
fees are designed for individual institutions.  Please contact
the <A HREF="mailto:ssp-info@umich.edu">SSP</A> for information
on multi-institution fees.
<H4>Fees</H4>
An annual fee (currently $3,000 for "local" institutions and $6,000 for "remote" institutions) provides each participating institution
with support for six core collections and access to the ongoing
development effort.  The collections, listed on the SSP web site,
represent resources that we believe are (a) of general interest,
(b) will change sufficiently through updates and corrections,
and (c) which require a substantial, ongoing development effort
to improve and extend access.  The mechanisms designed for these
six core collections can be generalized by the participating institution
to other, similar or even heterogeneous collections.
<P>
&quot;Remote service&quot; institutions pay a higher annual fee.  
The increment in the higher fee is used for the purchase
and amortization of, and support for equipment at the University
of Michigan used to support these institutions.  Current equipment
includes a primary server (a dual processor Sun 2170) with large
capacity RAID directly attached to UM fiber ring, as well as a
&quot;backup&quot; server at a separate UM site which mirrors
the collections.  We believe that these collections are (or can
become) integral to teaching and research, and that this level
of fail-safe is important to build confidence among faculty and
students.  &quot;Remote service&quot; institutions can ask to
have collections installed on a server at their own institution
at any time during their participation, and can in fact mount
some collections locally and some remotely.
<H4>Additional collections</H4>
Collections will be added to the program as capacity allows and
needs arise.  The fee for these collections will reflect several
aspects of cost.  
<OL>
<LI>The base cost for each collection will be the cost of developing
access mechanisms and the cost of distribution and support.  For
example, a simple collection which will not be updated will have
a relatively low cost.
<LI>For institutions not in the SGML Server Program, a separate
component of the cost will be reflected for participation in the
SSP.  This cost will cover support and training not specific to
the collection.
<LI>For institutions accessing the collection on the server(s)
at the University of Michigan, a final component of cost will
cover a portion of the cost for servers and support.
</OL>

<P>
We are eager to receive requests for new collections.  Priority
will be given to requests from current members of the SSP, and
the University of Michigan must determine whether it has the resources
to license the collection, or whether it can negotiate rights
for processing without providing online access.<BR>

<H3>What the SSP is</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The SSP is an SGML development operation. Building access
for each collection entails a rigorous phase of document analysis
and assessment.  We ask questions such as &quot;What are the primary
methods of organization?&quot; and  &quot;How would most people
use the collection?&quot; in designing each piece of &quot;middleware.&quot;
 Of course there are limitations in both the commercial software
we use, and in the display capabilities of the WWW.  On the other
hand, we believe we have developed sophisticated mechanisms for
getting around limitations in both of these areas, and use knowledge
we have developed in building access to each collection when we
develop mechanisms for others.
<LI>The SSP is a non-profit enterprise approved by the University
of Michigan's funded research organization, the Division of Research,
Development &amp; Administration (DRDA), and operated by staff
in the Humanities Text Initiative.
<LI>We hope that the SSP is an empowering or enabling operation.
 The SSP is designed to enable other institutions to develop access
to SGML-based resources in increasingly powerful and flexible
ways.  By providing both code and training to participating institutions,
we hope we are able to aid other institutions in increasing the
number of richly encoded documents accessible to their own and
other institutions.
</UL>


<H3>What the SSP is <I>not</I></H3>
<UL>
<LI>The SSP is not a for-profit enterprise.  Funds generated are
used for continued development and for amortized purchase of hardware
and software.  Hardware and software are replaced or upgraded
as needed for reasonable support of the &quot;remote service&quot;
participants, and infrastructure funds are managed in such a way
as to support this process.
<LI>The SSP is not an end-user support service.  Not only is it
unrealistic for us to provide support to the users at each campus-even
all the staff at each library-but it is also, we believe, a disservice
to the participating institutions.  The collections provided online
are integral parts of the institution's local collection resources.
 By mediating support to end users, the public service and collection
development staff at each institution better understand the ends
to which these resources are put.  Similarly, by mediating support
to other staff, the SSP representations at each institution are
better able to resolve generic problems in an ongoing way.
<LI>The SSP is not a software development operation.  Although
original binaries and code are developed at the HTI and distributed
to participating institutions, the value of these resources is
tied integrally to the commercial search software from OpenText,
and the collections around which the mechanisms were developed.

<H3>About the HTI</H3>
The Humanities Text Initiative is an SGML creation and support
unit at the University of Michigan.  It draws on substantial experience
with building Internet-based access to collections in SGML.  The
HTI's origins are in the University Library's 1989 efforts to
create an Internet-based &quot;textual analysis&quot; capability
through a service then known as UMLibText (see Price-Wilkin, "Text Files in Libraries: Present Foundations and Future Directions," <I>Library Hi Tech</I>, Consecutive Issue 35,
(1991)7-44).  Since then, the HTI has amassed perhaps the Internet's
largest and certainly richest collection of materials in SGML,
working with publishers and other academic operations to design
and build access mechanisms.  Materials range in scope and complexity
from <I>Physicians' GenRx</I> (a pharmacological reference work
by Mosby, providing the same FDA approved prescribing information
found in the <I>Physicians' Desk Reference</I>, as well as therapeutic
equivalents, wholesale cost data, drug approval and patent dates,
and detailed information on drug manufacturers) to the King James
Version of the Bible.  The HTI has worked directly with publishers
such as Groliers, Elsevier, and organizations such as the Dictionary
of Old English and the Human Relations Area Files to build access
mechanisms.  It currently provides online access to several encyclopedias
and dictionaries, multimedia collections, reference works in the
sciences as well as the humanities, and vast literary collections.
