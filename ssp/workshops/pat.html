<H3>Introducing PAT (page 1)</H3>
PAT is a text database system.  It is often used to find information in a large collection of documents.
You type a prefix, word, or phrase; PAT tells you hpw many times it appears in the text.  You can then
print all or some fraction of the matches, each match surrounded by some context.  You can find prefixes, 
words or phrases that appear near other specified text, or find those that appear most often.  Searches 
can also be restricted to certain parts of the text.  Whoever installs PAT to work with a particular database
defines what characters signal the beginning of a prefix, word, or phrase; what characters (if any) should be 
interpreted by PAT as other characters (upper case characters as lower, for example); and whether PAT should ignore certain 
characters completely (common words, for example).

<H3>What is PAT? (page 7)</H3>
PAT is a useful tool for searching text.  You can use PAT to search for prefixes, words, or phrases.  PAT can search for a 
lengthy phrase as quickly as for a single word.  PAT can also search for text that appears near other specified text and for
text that appears frequently.
<P>
Using PAT, you can search through the entire text or only a portion.  For example, a search through a collection of technical papers
can be restricted to only the abstracts.  Restricting searches to selected compontents of the text is easiest
when the text contains tags that mark the start and end of each component (&lt;abstract&gt; and &lt;/abstract&gt;, for example).
A collection of technical papers that has its titles, authors, abstracts, and content marked by different tags can be easily segmented into
compontents for searching.

<H3>How PAT Searches (pages 21-23)</H3>
PAT takes what you type and looks for an exact replica in the text.  You can match any prefixes, words, or phrases
that appear in the text by typing them exactly as they appear.  PAT then takes your pattern of characters
and tries to find the same pattern in the text; PAT has no knowledge of the meaning of the text and no built-in information about synonyms
to words you type.
<P>
It is important to think of PAT strictly as a pattern matcher so you can interpret your results accurately.  For example, if you are using 
PAT to search an encyclopedia for references to insects, typing <STRONG>insect</STRONG> is a logical starting point.  You will find all
occurences to the pattern <STRONG>insect</STRONG>; that is, all words that start with the characters <STRONG>i,n,s,e,c,t</STRONG>.
<P>
However, there are many categories and classes of insects (bug, fly, vermin) not to mention specific types of
insects (ladybug, louse, earwig) or even variant names of a specific insect (ladybug, ladybird or lady beetle).
Furthermore, the term <STRONG>insect</STRONG> misght be misspelled in the text.  None of the above occurences will
be retrieved by searching for <STRONG>insect</STRONG>.  You must anticipate what words might be used in the text to describe the type of information 
you are after.  It is the person at the keyboard, not PAT, who investigates and provides the appropriate
search terms.
<P>
PAT knows nothing about grammatical constructs like words or phrases.  PAT can be set up so that when you type a pattern
like <STRONG>light</STRONG>, the program looks for this pattern anywhere in the text, for example, within delighted, lighted or as the word light.
Every character in teh text can be matched, or more technically, every character can be <i>indexed</i>.
<P>
It is not always desireable that every character be indexed.  It is normally more useful to index by word beginnings
(unless you are interested in searching suffixes).  You specify what type of index you wish to build as part of the 
index building procedure for a particular text.
<P>
Notice that PAT know nothing about the ends of words.  PAT simply finds whatever begins with what you
type.  The pattern <STRONG>light</STRONG> results in anything that starts with the characters 
<STRONG>light</STRONG>, which accounts for the match to <STRONG>lighted</STRONG>.  Similarly, the pattern
<STRONG>"light "</STRONG> results in anything that starts with the characters <STRONG>light</STRONG> followed
by a space (PAT does not understand this as a word, just as a sequence of characters, one of which happens to 
be a space).
