<h3>Interface creation (forms, search restrictions, cgi interactions, etc.)</h3> 
<p>This afternoon's exercise will be designing an interface to the heterogeneous collection comprised of all of our texts. We will be asking you to break up into working groups to design the interface and we'll spend the last portion of the day comparing our design decisions. You may do something as simple as sketches of sample forms and pages or you may mock up a prototype in HTML -- in any case, have some visuals to share with the group.</p>

<p>Before you begin the hands on process, you may want to set out some design specifications such as:
<ul>
<li>what browser(s) are you designing for?</li>
<li>what size screen are you designing for?</li>
<li>what bit depth/color capacity are you designing for?</li>
<li>do you intend for this collection to be accessible by lynx?</li>
<li>what level of connectivity are you designing for?</li>
<li>to what degree do you want to rely on color, fonts, relative size, etc to convey meaning?</li></ul>

Some articulation of the reasoning behind these issues is also useful.</p>

<p>Now begin mocking up a design.  You'll probably want to consider some of the following:
<ol>
<li>what are the entry points into the collection?</li>
<li>what types of searches are useful?</li>
<li>what restrictions to searches should be offered and where?</li>
<li>what are default settings?</li>
<li>what are the entry points into the texts?</li>
<li>how do you order and display results?</li><li>what happens when there are no hits?</li>
<li>what happens when there are too many hits?</li>
<li>how do you display search restrictions and options on the forms?</li>
<li>is there anything peculiar to the content which will create display problems?</li>
 
</ol></p>
<p><b>Remember that all interface design decisions have to be supported by the mark-up of the collection!</b></p>
<p>I'd like to encourage you to work without models, except for those of course that you have in your heads.  But if you're stumped, you can of course take a look at what we've done for our collections, such as:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/stacks">any of the HTI collections</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.umdl.umich.edu/moa">The Making of America</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.umdl.umich.edu/peak">PEAK</a></li>

<h3>Some questions for the end of the day</h3>
<ul>
<li>Which decisions were easy to come to an accord on?</li>
<li>Which decisions were difficult to come to an accord on?</li>
<li>In what ways did the mark-up constrain your design decisions?</li>
<li>What challenges were posed by the heterogeneity of the collections?</li>
<li>If you could round up a focus group of target users to consult on the interface development, what would you ask them?</li>
</ul></p>
