<li><b>Validate the file within AuthorEditor.</b> Make sure that your file
will validate before going to the next steps.</li><BR><BR>

<li><b>Export the AE file to a text file.</b>From the file menu, choose
export. You will be prompted to give the file a new name; use the same
name, replacing the <i>ae</i> extension with <i>sgm</i>.</li><BR><BR>

<li><b>Updating the SGML header.</b>This step involves several substeps.
In order to continue processing your new SGML file, you will have to
replace the AuthorEditor-created header with one that has more
information. The new header will contain special instructions for use with
the SGML browser Panorama.</li><br><br>

Here are some rudimentary explanations of Panorama stylesheets and navigators.  These are drawn from the online manual and you should consult that (under the Help menu in Panorama publisher) for more details and encouragement.</p>
<a name="attach"><h3>Attaching a Navigator</h3>
<p>
Navigators display a document's table of contents interactively.
Clicking on an item in the navigator displays the corresponding section of
the document, making it very easy to browse through longer documents.
Panorama Publisher allows you to create and edit navigators that can
display your table of contents as, for example, hierarchical text, simple
headings, a list of emphasized words, or even (as in the on-line manual),
a list of figures.</p> 

<P>You create a navigator by choosing which of the document's elements are
to be included in the navigator. The navigator can be created to reflect
the hierarchical structure of the elements selected.</P>


<P>To create a navigator file, follow these procedures:
<ol>
<LI> Choose <i>Attach Navigator</i> from the Navigator menu.</LI>
<LI> Enter a name for the navigator file in the File Name field of the dialog and click on <b>OK</b>. The <FILE>.nav</FILE> extension is added automatically.</LI>
 </ol>

<h4>Nested navigator entries</h4>
<P>You will probably want your navigator entries to be nested in order to
reflect the structure of the document. As in the illustration above, the
document might have DIV1 elements (each with an H1 header) which contain DIV2 elements (each with an H2 header). If you choose
H1 and H2 as simple navigator entries, they will be displayed at the same level in the navigator. If you want the H2 navigator entries to be nested inside the
H1 entries so that you can show or hide them (by clicking
on the expanding or contracting icons you should specify H1 parent element whe you create the navigator entry. This is done by clicking on the arrow in the
Navigator Entry list, and choosing DIV1
H1 from the list (the element context list is generated
automatically by Panorama Publisher). This is displayed as DIV1>>H1 in the Defined Entries list. </P>

<P>In general, if you want lower-level navigator entries to be nested, you
need to include the parent element when you create the higher level navigator entries, provided that the parent element also contains the element used for the lower-level navigator.</P>
<P>You can choose the parent of the currently selected element by clicking
on the [P] button to the right of the Navigator Entry pull-down list.</P>
<P>When you've finished making all of your changes to the navigator entry:
<ol>
<LI> Click on [Add] to add this entry to the list of
defined entries.</LI>
<LI> To save your navigator definition, click on [OK]. To
cancel any changes made, click on [ Cancel].</LI>
</ol>
</P>

<P>To edit a navigator, choose Edit Navigator from the Navigator menu.</P>

<a name="style"><h3>Creating and Editing Stylesheets</h3>

<p>Panorama's style sheets provide you with a great deal of control over
the display of any document. The Publisher version allows publishers and
users to add or create any number of style sheets, each with its own name.
Style sheets give you control over display attributes such as font, size,
weight, color, indents, spacing and automatic numbering.</p>

<P>To create a style sheet, follow these procedures. 
<ol>
<LI> Open the document that you want to format.</LI>
<LI>  Choose <i>Attach Style Sheet</i> from the Styles menu (this command can be used only if the DTD  has a public identifier).</LI>
<LI> Enter a file name for the style sheet in the File
Name field of the file chooser dialog and click on the
[OK] button. The .ssh extension is added automatically.</LI>
<LI> Enter a descriptive name for the style sheet. This name will identify
the style sheet in the Styles menu.</LI>
<LI> Click on [OK].</LI>
</ol>
The style sheet initially contains some basic, default properties (for
example, all elements are displayed on separate lines). You will want to
change these using the style sheet editor.</P>

<P>By default, all elements inherit the styles of their parent element. To
make creating a new style sheet simpler, begin by setting
the styles for the highest level element, then change only those styles of
the lower level elements that you do not want inherited.</P>

<h4>Editing a style sheet</h4>
<P>You can use the style sheet editor to determine how an element will
look in a Panorama Publisher document. You can open the style sheet editor
by clicking the right mouse button in the document window on the text
whose appearance you want to change, and choosing <i>Edit Style</i>
from the pop-up menu. The style sheet editor dialog box appears.</P>
