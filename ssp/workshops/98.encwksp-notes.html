<H3>SSP Text Encoding and User Support Workshop</H3>
<BR><B>Dates:</B> July 22-25, 1998
<BR><B>Instructors:</B> Chris Powell and Maria Bonn, University of Michigan, and Perry Willett, Indiana University
<BR><B>Program:</B> The workshop will focus on text encoding; document analysis, including DTD reading and using PAT; interface design; and user support.  We will build a small collection of TEI-encoded texts and deploy it.  The instructors will be supported by Nigel Kerr and Alan Pagliere. 
<BR><B>NOTE:</B>  This workshop is limited to a total of 10 persons.
<BR><B>Prerequisites:</B> To make best use of this workshop, we will expect that attendees: 
<OL><LI>own a copy of Author/Editor and be familiar with it
<LI>have read assigned texts about the principles of SGML 
</OL>
<P><B>Required Readings:</B>
<UL>
<LI>SGML Primer: <A HREF="http://www.sq.com/sgmlinfo/primintr.html">Introduction</A> and <A HREF="http://www.sq.com/sgmlinfo/primbody.html">Body</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/bin/tei-search-idx?type=extoc&byte=71769">The Gentle Introduction to SGML from the TEI Guidelines</A>
<LI><A HREF="pat.html">Introductory portions of the Pat 5.0 manual</A>
</UL>
<BR><B>Schedule (tentative):</B>

<H4>Day 1</H4>
<H5>Morning (9 a.m. to noon, with a break):</H5>
<LI>Introductions and course objectives<br>
<i>MB, CP and PW with a few context setting remarks by NK and/or AP</i> </LI>
<LI>Text selection and beginning encoding (large structures)<br>
<i>participants will be encouraged to bring their own texts; sample texts will also be available</i></LI>

<H5>Afternoon (1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a break):</H5>
<LI>Reading a DTD <i>CP & PW</i><br>Participants may wish to look at <A HREF="http://www.sq.com/sgmlinfo/primbody.html#dtdsamp">this sample</a> from the SGML Primer and <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/bin/tei-search-idx?type=HTML&rgn=DIV3&byte=95071">this sample</a> from the Gentle Introduction</LI>
<LI>Introduction to PAT <i>CP & PW</i><br>Participants will be talked though some sample commands in PAT especially those which are clearly related to the searches we offer and then asked to explore the DAAP of African American Poetry using PAT to accomplish set tasks.  These tasks will look toward the document analysis portion of the workshop on Day 2.  <i>Sooty may be filling in here just what exercises she has in mind</i>.</LI>

<H4>Day 2</H4>

<H5>Morning:</H5>
<LI>Text encoding (small structures, notes and quotes, front matter) <i>PW</i></LI>

<H5>Afternoon:</H5>
<LI>Document analysis of an electronic collection <i>CP</i><br>In this portion of our program we will ask people to think about how the collection is structured and what aspects of the structure need to be attended to.  These will include:<ol><li>how many items are in the collections?</li><li>how many levels are there in an item</li><li>what are points to hang a link on/to?</li><li>where are heads used?</li><li>what are some interesting features of the encoding that provide search possibilities? (gender, period)</li></ol> As they are doing the document analysis we will ask them what hopes and expectations they would bring to the collection and  how they would determine what's really possible given the mark-up.  We also want to raise the question of what they as collection implementers do when they don't understand the content of the collection -- how do you fill the gaps in your knowledge? <i>We may hand them some sample CH documentation to puzzle over.  Also may give them a print out of one CHAD of encoded text so that we have a handout to refer to in common.  Sooty will devise some document analyis exercises for the crowd.</i> </LI>

<H4>Day 3</H4>

<H5>Morning:</H5>
<LI>Text encoding (remaining issues) <i>PW</i></LI>
<LI>Viewing texts in Panorama, attaching and modifying stylesheets <i>MB</i><br>The troops will export their texts, which should be finished and valid at this point, to sgml and then view them in Panorama. We will talk about Panorama for display and for structural analysis.  MB will lead the group through a sample style sheet creation and then ask them to make style sheets for their texts, as if those texts were representative of an entire collection.  At the end of the day we will share the styles we have created and talk about how the design choices (should!) reflect the structures of the text.</LI><li><a href="/misc/ssp/workshops/panorama.html">here are basic instructions</a> I've put together.

<H5>Afternoon:</H5>
<LI>Interface creation (forms, search restrictions, cgi interactions, etc.) <i>MB  & CP</i><br><a href="/misc/ssp/workshops/intf-ex.html">Here's the formal exercise</a><br>The afternoon's exercise will be actually building an interface to the heterogenous collection comprised of all of their texts.  Hopefully this starts to get at cross collection issues at the same time that it takes us through standard interface decisions such as:<ol><li>what are default settings?</li><li>what types of searches are useful?</li><li>what restrictions to searches should be offered and where?</li><li>what are the entry points into the collection?</li><li>what are the entry points into the texts?</li><li>how do you order and display results?</li><li>what happens when there are no hits?</li><li>what happens when there are too many hits?</li><li>how do you display search restrictions and options on the forms?</li><li><i>can you kids fill in some others here? something about what browser versions you are designing for? do you need to support lynx? that kind of thing?</i></ol></LI>

<H4>Day 4</H4>

<H5>Morning:</H5>
<LI>Deploying texts: normalization, line numbering, joining texts into a
collection <i>NK & AP</i></LI>

<H5>Afternoon:</H5>
<LI>Assessment of our collections <i>MB and CP</i> <br>We will be asking for comments and thoughts on at least the following:<ol><li>some of the new stuff we've done with the personal collection implementations</li><li>the value of the collection selector and how it should be organized</li><li>the hits overview vs kwic debates</li><li>the role of the compare feaure</li><li>the usefulness of the help database</li></ol> <i>If mbonn had her head together she may devise some quasi-formal assessment techniques or some exercises that tie their feedback into larger theoretical issues</i></LI>
<LI>User support issues <i>MB, CP and PW </i><br><i>The grrls are hoping that Mr. Willett will have a fair bit to say here since he is a bit more in the trenches here than we are, but we think the following merit some discussion:</i><ol><li>how does the digital library operate within the context of the traditional library?</li><li>what are the types of user support and how do you provide them?</li><li>do you need to separate out content support from technical support?</li><li>who is responsible for training?</li><li>what kinds of questions do we get most often here at HTI/DLPS and how do we deal with them?</li></ol></LI>

<P>If interest in the first (i.e., technical) workshop is particularly high, we will schedule a second technical workshop in August 1998 to focus on MOA-style implementation.  Please register your interest by sending mail to <A HREF="mailto:ssp-info@umich.edu">ssp-info@umich.edu</A>.
