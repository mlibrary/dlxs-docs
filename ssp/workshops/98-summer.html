<H2>Summer 1998 SSP Workshops</H2>
<P>Two workshops will be offered during the Spring/Summer 1998 for participants in the SGML Server Program.  The first is intended for persons with programming background who are or may be responsible for developing new systems.  The second is intended for public service, collection development, and electronic text center staff who are integrally involved in problems of markup and end-user support.  Through these two workshops, we hope to give participants experience with advanced issues in resource creation, system design, and functionality of the code made available to the institutions as part of the SSP.

<H3>SSP Technical Workshop</H3>
<B>Dates:</B>  June 18-21, 1998
<BR><B>Instructors:</B> Nigel Kerr and Alan Pagliere

<BR><B>Program:</B>  This workshop is intended for those people from SSP insitutions who want to or are interested in using the SSP Platform (the CGI perl code and libraries for managing interaction with PAT/OT) to put access mechanisms to new collections not distributed through the SSP.
<BR><B>NOTE:</B>  This workshop is limited to a total of 10 persons.

<BR><B>Prerequisites:</B>  To make best use of this workshop, we will expect that attendees:<OL>
<LI>have some familiarity with SGML.</LI>
<LI>have some familiarity with perl5.</LI>
<LI>have seen the kinds of online collections DLPS makes available already (see <A HREF="http://www.umdl.umich.edu/">http://www.umdl.umich.edu/</A> and <A HREF="http://www.hti.umich.edu/">http://www.hti.umich.edu/</A> for examples).</LI>
<LI>have either the PAT50 package or Livelink package 7.2 or later from OpenText.</LI>
<LI>have read and thought about the required readings (to follow) and samples of perl5 code.</LI>
<LI>it is desirable that:<OL>
<LI>attendees have some SGML that they are interested in making an online interface for, and which can be used as examples specific to their needs during the course of the workshop.</LI>
<LI>having some EAD content is also desirable.</LI></OL></OL>
<P><B>Required Readings:</B>

 Exploiting an SGML-aware system through the Web (Price-Wilkin)</A></LI>
</LI>
 
<LI><A HREF="http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/findaids/ead/guidelines/">EAD documentation</A></LI> <!-- nigelk, you might want to think about making the application guidelines available in some more meaningful way. You could take their postscript and PDF them with the acrobat stuff we have on dlps1 (i think in /l0/acrobat/bin), for example -->
 
<LI>perl code provided by the instructors.</LI>
</UL>

<BR><B>Components:</B>  This workshop will focus on:
<OL>
<LI>indexing SGML collections with PAT50 and Livelink 7.2+ (if participants all have one or the other, just the one represented package will be used).</LI>

<LI>using the PAT50/OT60 query language to specify and retrieve items of interest in the text.</LI>

<LI>using the SSP Platform, a set of perl5 modules and templates, to build online interfaces to the indexed collections.</LI>
</OL>
This workshop will have an EAD focus: the EAD system at the University of Michigan will be used as an example, and the (unsupported) SSP platform code on which it is based will be available for participants to take with them.

<H3>SSP Text Encoding and User Support Workshop</H3>
<BR><B>Dates:</B> July 22-25, 1998
<BR><B>Instructors:</B> Chris Powell and Maria Bonn, University of Michigan, and Perry Willett, Indiana University
<BR><B>Program:</B> The workshop will focus on text encoding; document analysis, including DTD reading and using PAT; interface design; and user support.  We will build a small collection of TEI-encoded texts and deploy it.  The instructors will be supported by Nigel Kerr and Alan Pagliere. 
<BR><B>NOTE:</B>  This workshop is limited to a total of 10 persons.
<BR><B>Prerequisites:</B> To make best use of this workshop, we will expect that attendees: 
<OL><LI>own a copy of Author/Editor and be familiar with it
<LI>have read assigned texts about the principles of SGML 
</OL>

<P>If interest in the first (i.e., technical) workshop is particularly high, we will schedule a second technical workshop in August 1998 to focus on MOA-style implementation.  Please register your interest by sending mail to <A HREF="mailto:ssp-info@umich.edu">ssp-info@umich.edu</A>.
