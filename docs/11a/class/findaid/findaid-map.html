<DIV CLASS="pageTitle">Collection Map Files (Finding Aids)</DIV><H1>Creating
and Modifying the Map File</H1>
<P>This document describes what we call <i>maps</i> or <i>map files</i>. Map
   files contain mapped items where one term or name for the item is mapped to
   another term or name. For example, a term used by an HTML form to refer to
   a searchable region (e.g., &quot;entire finding aid&quot;) can be mapped to
   an XPAT searchable region (e.g., EAD).</P>
<P>Currently, the format of the map files is SGML and each collection map file
   conforms to a simple DTD (other ways of mapping terms, such as a database
   where one could map from one column's data to another are possible and have
   been considered for implementation). The map is read into a <A HREF="../../program/dlxs-libmodules.html#terminologymapper">TerminologyMapper</A> object
   during the running of the middleware after which the CGI program can at any
   time request of the object the mappings for terms. Each mapped item and its
   various terms are contained within a &lt;MAPPING&gt; element.</P>
<P>An example map file for the sample finding aids collection can be found at <TT>$DLXSROOT/misc/f/findaid/maps/samplefa.map</TT>.
   Rather than modifying this file, a new map file should be created for each
   collection. </P>
<P>Each mapping element in a map file consists of the following:</P>
<DL> <DT><TT>label</TT></DT><DD>This element determines what will display in
the user's browser when constructing searches. It must match the value used in
the <A HREF="../../collmeta/dlxs-collmgr.html">collmgr</A>. </DD><DT><TT>synthetic</TT></DT><DD>This
contains the variable name as it is used in the cgi.</DD><DT><TT>native</TT></DT><DD>The &quot;native&quot; element
provides an appropriate XPAT search that the system will use to discover the
appropriate content. The search may be simple (e.g., <TT>region EADID</TT>) or
complex (e.g., <TT>((region DID within region ARCHDESC) not within region DSC)</TT>) </DD><DT><TT>nativeregionname</TT></DT><DD>The
element name itself, as it is indexed, without terms used in the XPAT search.</DD></DL>
