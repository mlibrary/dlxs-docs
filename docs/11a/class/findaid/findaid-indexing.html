<DIV CLASS="pageTitle">Indexing the Collection (Finding Aids)</DIV>
<P>After you have followed all the steps to set up your directories and prepare
   your files, as found in the <A HREF="./findaid-prep.html">finding aids preparation
   documentation</A>, indexing the collection is fairly straightforward. To create
   an index for use with the Findaid Class interface, you will need to index
   the words in the collection, then index the XML (the structural metadata,
   if you will), and then finally "fabricate" structures based on a combination
   of elements (for example, defining what the "main entry" is, without adding
   a &lt;MAINENTRY&gt; tag around the appropriate &lt;AUTHOR&gt; or &lt;TITLE&gt; element).
   The following commands can be used to make the index, alone or in combination. </P>
<OL>
<LI>Ensure that your collection is valid by running <TT>make validate</TT>, which
   will use the <TT>dlxsead2002.dtd</TT> to validate the full xml file.</LI>
<LI> <TT>make singledd</TT> indexes words for texts that have been concatenated
   into one large file for a collection. Creating an index from a single file
   (as opposed to multi file system indexing) is the recommended process for
   reasons of speed and reliability. Use the <TT>make singledd</TT> command in
   the Makefile stored at <TT>$DLXSROOT/bin/c/collid/Makefile</TT> .</LI>
<LI> <TT>make xml</TT> indexes the SGML structure by reading the DTD. sgmlrgn
   validates as it indexes, and is slower than multiregion indexing (see <A HREF="../../xpat/xpat-index.html">XPAT
   documentation</A> for more information) for this reason. However, this method
   necessary for collections that have nested elements of the same name (and
   the EAD DTD permits this). Use the <TT>make sgml</TT> command in the Makefile
   stored at $DLXSROOT/bin/c/collid/Makefile .</LI>
<LI> <b>make post</b> builds and indexes fabricated regions based on the XPat
   queries stored in the $DLXSROOT/prep/c/collid/{coll}.extra.srch file. Because
   every collection is different, this file will need to be adapted after you
   have determined what you want to use as the "main title" for a finding aid
   (e.g., perhaps the ORIGINATION within the DID within the ARCHDESC) and how
   many levels of components (e.g., nested to C04) you have in your collection.
   If you try to index/build fabricated regions from elements not used in your
   finding aids collection, you will see errors like <TT>Error found: &lt;Error&gt;syntax
   error before: ")&lt;/Error&gt; </TT> when you use the <TT>make post</TT> command
   in the Makefile stored at $DLXSROOT/bin/c/collid/Makefile .</LI>
</OL>
<P>You have now built indexes and region files for your collection. You can test
   that things are properly indexed by issuing the command <TT>xpat $DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid/collid.dd</TT> and
   doing searches, such as <TT>region "c02"</TT> and <TT>region "main"</TT> .
   For more information about searching, see the <A HREF="../../xpat/xpat-manual.html">XPAT
   manual</A> .Strategically, it is good to test this from a directory other
   than the one you indexed in, to ensure that relative or absolute paths are
   resolving appropriately. </P>
