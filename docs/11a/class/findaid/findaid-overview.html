<DIV CLASS="pageTitle"> Overview of Findaid Class </DIV><H1> Abstract </H1>
<P> <A NAME="Description"/> The Findaid Class consists of EAD2002-encoded Finding
   Aids. You can learn more about the ead2002 dtd and ead2002 in general at the <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/ead/" TARGET="external"> Library
   of Congress ead2002 site </A> . </P>
<H1> Description </H1><H2> Basic Characteristics </H2>
<P> The Finding Aids Class is in many ways similar in behavior to <A HREF="../text/tc-index.html"> Text
      Class </A> . Access minimally includes full text searching across collections
      or within a particular collection of Finding Aids, viewing Finding Aids
      in a variety of display formats, and creation of personal collections ("bookbag")
      of Finding Aids. </P>
<H2> General Characteristics </H2>
<UL>
   <LI> Allows search and retrieval of ead2002-endcoded Finding Aids and portions
      thereof </LI>
   <LI> Allows searching across multiple collections of Finding Aids simultaneously </LI>
   <LI> Allows searching of each collection independently </LI>
   <LI> Allows bookmarking of individual Finding Aids </LI>
   <LI> Requires minimal administrative data </LI>
   <LI> Uses a single data model and shared middleware for all collections in
      the system </LI>
   <LI> Permits access restrictions at the collection level </LI>
</UL>
<P> At the University of Michigan, the Findaid Class access system is administered
   by the Digital Library Production Service. XML is received on a periodic basis
   from a variety of organizations on campus, and DLPS handles the process of
   putting the data online in a production-level environment. </P>
<P> The Finding Aids Class provides no functionality for creating and managing
   electronic texts in SGML. </P>
<H3>Typical Sources of Data</H3>
<P>The following sources of data have influenced the process defining the Findaid
   Class. Other sources are possible. </P>
<UL>
   <LI>Archival and Special Collections Libraries: finding aids converted to
      the ead2002 DTD, especially the <A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~bhl">Bentley
      Historical Library</A> at the University of Michigan which has well-established
      encoding practices</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Typical Applications of the Class</H3>
<UL>
   <LI>Campus access </LI>
   <LI>Public access </LI>
</UL>
<H3> Behaviors of the Findaid Class </H3>
<UL>
   <LI> Cross-collection searching in any combination of collections </LI>
   <LI> Selection of collections </LI>
   <LI> Collection-specific searching </LI>
   <LI> Simple and Boolean searching </LI>
   <LI> Searching within a user-selected Finding Aid </LI>
   <LI> Ability to review and revise previous searches </LI>
   <LI> Viewing of sections of a Finding Aid or the full text in HTML, and display
      in context of search terms found </LI>
   <LI> Ability to select particular Finding Aids for saving in a session-based
      personal collection, or bookbag, and to download or email these </LI>
</UL>
<H2> Formal Data Definition </H2>
<P> <A NAME="Descriptive_Metadata__text_"/> The Findaid Class relies on a single
   XML Document Type Definition (DTD) to deliver all collections in the class
   which is essentially ead2002 DTD (see the <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/ead/" TARGET="external"> Library
   of Congress ead2002 site</A>), with one extra wrapping element. The XML is
   then indexed with XPAT and made searchable on the Web by the Findaid Class
   middleware. </P>
