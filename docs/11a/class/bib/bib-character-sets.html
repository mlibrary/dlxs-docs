<P>At the current time, XPAT (the DLXS search engine) supports both 7- and 8-bit
   character sets, with no specific ties to any standard or non-standard character
   set. The following approaches are equally possible:</P>
<OL>
<LI>An 8-bit ISO Latin 1 approach in the data dictionary (the <TT>.dd</TT> file),
   mapping characters with diacritics to their unaccented form (e.g., an "a" with
   umlaut would be searchable as an "a").</LI>
<LI>An 8-bit ISO Latin 1 approach in the data dictionary, leaving characters
   with diacritics searchable in their accented form (e.g., an "a" with umlaut
   would be searchable only as an "a" with umlaut).</LI>
<LI>An 8-bit ISO Latin 2 approach in the data dictionary, mapping characters
   with diacritics to their unaccented form (e.g., an "a" with macron would be
   searchable as an "a").</LI>
<LI>... and so forth</LI>
</OL>
<P>The most common approach is to rely primarily on 8-bit representations of
   ISO Latin 1 mappings for the bulk of the characters, and character entity
   references for most other cases (e.g., &amp;amacr;). A sample data dictionary
   using 8-bit ISO Latin 1 values is linked <A HREF="bib-sample.dd">here</A> as
   an example of this approach.</P>
<P>We do not yet provide filtering of these character entity set-based characters
   to displayable representations, but will probably use transparent GIFs as
   an interim strategy (as we do elsewhere in DLXS classes).</P>
<P>Currently, we offer no documentation here for converting characters to ISO
   Latin 1 values. In the interim, see the <A HREF="../image/image-charconversion.html">Image
   Class Character Set Conversion</A>.</P>
