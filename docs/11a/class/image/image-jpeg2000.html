<H2><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>

 <P>
Image Class supports JPEG2000 compressed images in the JP2
format. The <a href="http://www.kakadusoftware.com/">Kakadu</A>
 Software Development Kit was used to implement functionality nearly
identical to that offered with MrSID from 
<a href="http://www.lizardtech.com">LizardTech</A>. High compression ratios
using wavelet compression, multiple image sizes, zooming, and panning
are all included. 
</P>
<P>
Command line compression and expansion utilities for Solaris and Linux are provided with
DLXS to paying DLXS subscribers. These utilities may also be licensed
from Kakadu Software. We are simply using the "demo" utilties,
kdu_compress and kdu_expand.
</P>
<P>The University of Michigan Library has a license for
the Kakadu Software (SDK) that allows non-commercial redistribution of
compiled applications. Visit <a href="http://www.kakadusoftware.com">Kakadu Software</A> to learn more about
additional licensing options.</P>



 
<H2><A NAME="Compression"></A>Compression</H2>
<P>
The kdu_compress utilitiy accepts a long list of options that will not
be explained here. The following will generate a JPEG2000 compressed
JP2 file with roughly 20:1 compression and 5 images sizes. The rate
option is used to control the amount of compression. The Clevels
option is for controlling the number of image sizes.
</P>
<CODE>kdu_compress -i filename.bmp -o filename.jp2 -Clevels=5 -rate 1.09</CODE>

<P>
David Taubman, creator/owner of Kakadu Software stated in the online
discussion forum, "The JPEG2000 standard has no explicit definition for a quality
factor (neither does the JPEG standard for that matter).  As
a general rule, the rate-distortion slope threshold often turns out
to be a more reliable indicator of quality than the bit-rate.  I
would suggest compressing some images which are typical of
your application to the point which you believe represents a
sufficient quality, then looking at the slope thresholds reported
by "kdu_compress" in its verbose (default) mode.  You can then
compress all your images, using the "-slope" option." 
</P>
<P>Using -slope to control quality has not yet been explored at the
University of Michigan.</P>

<P>It is a bit of a problem that the Kakadu utilities do not support a
wider range of formats for input and output. It is not a priority of
Kakadu Software to add additional formats. There are many other
existing utilities for converting files to one of the formats
supported for input. <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</A> is probably best known.
</P>



 
<H2><A NAME="Expansion"></A>Expansion</H2>

<P>Expansion of JPEG2000 compressed image files in the JP2 format can
be done with kdu_expand. The "-reduce" option is used to specify the
desired image size referenced by level (see -Clevel compression option
above). Note that the largest size is level 0.</P>

<CODE>kdu_expand -i filename.jp2 -o filename.bmp -reduce 2</CODE>

<P>
QuickTime (Macintosh only at this time) is capable of opening JP2
files created by Kakadu. In fact Apple uses Kakadu for JPEG2000
support in QuickTime.
</P>

<P>Image Class middleware uses the cjpeg program to convert output
from kdu_expand to create a JPEG compressed image to send to the
browser. cjpeg is part of libjpeg and is often included on UNIX
systems by default. If not, it can be found on the web.</P>
