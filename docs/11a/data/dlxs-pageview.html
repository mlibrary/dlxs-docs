<DIV CLASS="pageTitle">Copying Page-level Metadata from <CODE>pageview.dat</CODE> files to a Database Store</DIV>

<P>As of Release 8, DLXS Text Class middleware employs standard database mechanisms for
storing page-level metadata (an improvement for scalability and
management from the legacy <CODE>pageview.dat</CODE> file mechanism). DLXS encourages
participants to move away from this legacy mechanism, and is currently working toward
release of a utility that can be used during digitization to populate the database
store directly as metadata is generated.</P>
<P>In the meantime, to help
transition materials that are using the legacy mechanism, we've
supplied a utility to copy metadata from <CODE>pageview.dat</CODE> files into the
database store (the Pageview table in the DLXS database) used by Text Class.</P>
<P>The utility <CODE>bin/t/text/importpageviewdata.pl</CODE> can be run once
(for a one-time cutover) or on a regular basis via <CODE>cron</CODE> or your preferred
scheduling utility (for situations where
<CODE>pageview.dat</CODE> files are still being maintained and updated).</P>
<P>The syntax is
<PRE>
  importpageviewdata.pl -d [directory] [-f]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The required <CODE>[directory]</CODE> argument specifies the directory to crawl for <CODE>pageview.dat</CODE> files.
If there is more than one, use <CODE>"directory1 directory2 directory3 ..."</CODE>,
with the quotes.</P>
<P>Directories may be excluded from crawling (for performance or other reasons) by creating files named <CODE>.importpageviewdata.skip</CODE> directly inside them. There is no limit on the number of directories that may be skipped using mechanism.</P>
<P>The optional <CODE>[-f]</CODE> argument specifies a "full" run. If used,
the recorded time of the previous run is
ignored, and all <CODE>pageview.dat</CODE> files are processed regardless of their
age. Without this argument, the utility runs in a "maintenance" mode,
copying only metadata changed since the last run to the database store
to increase performance and reduce database fragmentation and load.</P>
<P><CODE>importpageviewdata.pl</CODE> will automatically use the database, user, and
password that you entered when installing Text Class. If you manually
change these configurations in Text Class, <CODE>importpageviewdata.pl</CODE> will
honor the changes and connect using the new parameters.</P>
