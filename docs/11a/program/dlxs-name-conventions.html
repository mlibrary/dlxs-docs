<DIV CLASS="pageTitle">DLXS Middleware Naming Conventions</div>

<P>Several naming conventions have evolved in the writing of the DLXS Middleware. Being familiar with them
will help when looking at and possibly making changes to the Middleware code.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Subclass module names</LI>
  <LI>Variable names for most common object instantiations</LI>
  <LI>Method names</LI>
</UL>


<H2>Subclass Module Names</H2>
<P>Subclass modules generally carry some portion, even if abbreviated, of the name of
its superclass ancestry. For example, the top-level <TT>DLXSClass.pm</TT> is subclassed by <TT>BibClass.pm</TT>
 and <TT>FullTextClass.pm</TT>.
The latter is in turn subclassed by <TT>TextClass.pm</TT> and <TT>FindaidClass.pm</TT>. When 
<TT>TextClass.pm</TT> needs to be subclassed for
a particular collection, the collection id is used,
with the first letter capitalized, followed by "TC" to represent "TextClass". So,  in the case of
"Making of America", whose collection id is "moa", the collection subclass would be called <TT>MoaTC.pm</TT>.</P>
<P>See the <a href="./dlxs-object-hierarchy.html">DLXS Object Hierarchies</A>.</P>



<H2>Variable names for most common object instantiations</H2>
<P>Many DLXS Middleware-specific objects are created and used during the running of the CGI progam.
When an object is "new-ed up" or instantiated in Perl, a variable which is "blessed" as an object of
the class in question, is created. A convention has evolved for the naming of the variable by the 
calling code. Most of the variables have three-letter names (though a few have names of more than three letters).
The most common ones are listed below. On the left is the object (from the module/Class name). On the right, a typical
name for the variable that holds the reference to the object.
</P>
<P>Being a bit familier with these object names should ease the task of looking through code.

<H2>Method Names</H2>
<P>DLXS Programmers try to give methods names that are as self-documenting as possible.
Names are written in proper case; one string with no spaces, in which the words are marked only with
a capital letter.
</P>
<P>Examples include:
<UL>
<LI>GetMainSearches</LI>
<LI>Layer1ResultFormatter</LI>
<LI>BuildKwicLink</LI>
<LI>BuildViewEntireTextLink</LI>
</UL>
