<DIV CLASS="pageTitle">Debugging DLXS Perl Middleware Code</div>
          
          
            <P>Much code debugging can be accomplished in whatever development environment you may be using.  At DLPS we generally use XEmacs, along with its Comint mode for the Perl debugger. However, it is often helpful to investigate a program's behavior within the browser environment as well. There are occasional debugging statements in the code that will print values of specific variables or even dump entire objects in HTML. These are controlled by adding a parameter to any URL. Simply add a "
               <TT>
                  <B>;debug=
                     <I>value</I>
                  </B>
               </TT>
               " to a URL in your browser where 
               <I>value</I>
                is any of the following described below.</P>
             
            <P>Note that the value 
               <B>all</B>
                turns on all debugging switches and produces a considerable quantity of output, especially in the case of searches.</P>
             

          
            <H1>Debug Values Available in All Classes</H1>
             
            <P>These values pertain to the debugging output produced by modules in Lib i.e. 
               <TT>DLXSROOT/lib</TT>
                and as such they are common to all of the class middleware.</P>

XPAT for a variety of different search types.</LI>

               <DD>Prints a summary of the amount of time it takes the Class CGI to
run. It displays the elapsed time to compile and run the entire program (which
includes time to communicate with a local or remote XPAT process, and so
includes process startup, context switching, network latency, and inter-process
communication overhead). It also displays the CPU time devoted solely to the
process running the Class CGI. The difference between these two numbers is a
rough indication of the overhead to which the CGI is subject. </DD>

               </DT>
                
               <DD>Prints status when the QueryFactory object is created for a given collection object.  If the collection implements the use of XPAT mapping of special characters (e.g. 'Y' for yogh in Middle English) the transformation of these characters in the CGI object is called out at this point.</DD>

               <DD>Useful for tracing the construction of searches for the target of &lt;PTR> type notes.  Prints which mode of target region search was used, i.e. fabricated region search or explicitly coded list of regions.  Prints the XPAT query for the target region and the parent region of the target region.  Prints the overall restriction applied to limit the search to a particular main region.

                   subroutine to send a complete email summary of the data that caused an assertion failure.  This is useful in monitoring the health of production code in the absence of user feedback.</DD>

                   module to log process ids and associated URL strings for each XPAT process forked to execute a query.  At DLPS we couple this log file with a runaway process killer which kills XPAT processes that run for more than 1.5 minutes.  The process killer sends email notification and with the additional logged data we can determine the URL that generated the runaway and resolve the problem.</DD>

            <P>Related to the issue of ebugging is the issue off having multiple work directories for each developer. DLXS middleware supports this. There are ways of setting up "sandboxes" so that individuals can have their own environments for running and testing changes they are making, independently of others' work. For more information, see
