<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>xpatmaint</B> uses a five-stage, off-line process to merge the <I>append</I> database with the
<I>main</I> database.  If a <I>delete_file</I> is specified, <B>xpatmaint</B> will also delete
portions of the <I>main</I> database.
The first stage consists of a full scan of the <I>main</I> text to generate index
update directives.  The second stage consists of
an in-place update of the <I>main</I> text and the <I>main</I> index,
using the update directives produced in the first stage.
Also during the second stage,
the <I>append</I> text is physically appended to the end of the <I>main</I> text and
any specified deletion portions are physically removed from the <I>main</I> text.
The third stage consists of merging the region indices of the <I>append</I> database
with the region indices of the <I>main</I> database.  The region indices of the <I>main</I>
database are also updated to reflect the deleted portions of text.
The forth stage consists of merging the fast find indices from the <I>main</I> database
with the <I>append</I> database.
The fifth stage rebuilds the fast region indices either used by <I>main</I> database
or <I>append</I> database.
The final step updates the Data Dictionary for the <I>main</I> database.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS </H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
verbose - report progress through the stages of execution.  If <B>-v</B> is not
specified, <B>xpatmaint</B> works quietly.
<DT><B>-o</B><DD>
optimize - use optimization mode.
This option increases the speed with which the <I>main</I> text is scanned by
using a special speedup algorithm.  This algorithm increases
the amount of core memory allocated during the first stage.
This option should always be used if core memory is not an issue.
<DT><B>-l</B> <I>log_file</I><DD>
log - log progress through the stages of execution.
This option is similar in nature to the <B>-v</B> option, except that the output
is placed in a file.  <B>xpatmaint</B> will append log information if the specified
<I>log_file</I> already exists.
This makes the <I>log_file</I> useful as an audit trail for updates to the <I>main</I>
database.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

As mentioned above, <B>xpatmaint</B> physically modifies various files of the <I>main</I> database
during its 2nd to 5th stages.
Two requirements result from this method of operation.
The first requirement is to ensure that the database is backed
up before <B>xpatmaint</B> is run.  A backup is necessary because <B>xpatmaint</B> will leave the
database in an invalid state if it terminates abnormally during an update
operation.  In such cases, the database can be restored from backup and the
update can then be re-started.  See the section on 
<B>Partial Execution Options</B> section, below, for more details on re-starting
an update.
<P>
The second requirement is that the database be off-line (i.e. with nobody
searching it) while stages 2 to 5 are being performed.  This requirement
exists because the database is in an invalid state during these stages.  See
the section on
<B>Partial Execution Options</B> section, below, for more details on running
the various stages separately.
<P>
<B>xpatmaint</B> is usually run from the directory containing the <I>main</I> database.  Because of
this, file specifications in the <I>append</I>_<I>data_dictionary</I> should have full pathnames so they can
be located from anywhere in the file system, particularly from the <I>main</I>
database's directory.
<P>
For regions having the same name in both the <I>main</I>_<I>data_dictionary</I> and the <I>append</I>_<I>data_dictionary</I>, the
region information from the <I>append</I> database is merged into the corresponding
region file in the <I>main</I> database.  Any region from the <I>append</I> database, whose name
does not match a region name in the <I>main</I> database, is placed at the end of
the <I>main</I> database's `.rgn' file.  If the <I>main</I> database does not already have
a `.rgn' file, then one is created.
<P>
The index file in the <I>append</I> database is not used by <B>xpatmaint</B>.  Instead, <B>xpatmaint</B> 
rebuilds the index for
the <I>append</I> database using the index specifications in the <I>main</I>_<I>data_dictionary</I> before the index
merging takes place.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PARTIAL EXECUTION OPTIONS</H2>

During the first stage of <B>xpatmaint</B>, users can still search the database since the
<I>main</I> and <I>append</I> database text files are only scanned, not physically changed.
However, the <I>main</I> database must be taken off-line for the 2nd to 5th stages.
The first stage generally takes much longer to run than the other stages.
As such, 
it is sometimes convenient to have stage 1 run while users are using the
database (e.g. as a low-priority process during the day), and then run
stages 2 to 5 afterwards (e.g. at night).  This policy can be 
implemented using the partial execution options to <B>xpatmaint</B>.
<P>
If <B>xpatmaint</B> is run with only the <B>-1</B> option specified, it will
only perform stage 1 and will write the index update directives into a file
called <I>pmt_dir</I> in the current directory.  When the time
comes to perform stages 2 to 5, <B>xpatmaint</B> can be executed with the
<B>-2</B>, <B>-3</B>, <B>-4</B> and <B>-5</B>
options specified.  <B>xpatmaint</B> will then read the update directives
from the <I>pmt_dir</I> file and update the index and region indices.
If stage 4 is required, the <I>pmt_sv_dir</I> directives file
will be created during stage 2 processing.
It is required to have <I>pmt_sv_dir</I> directives to
to update the fast find index. The stage 5 does not need any directives.
<P>
There is another benefit from these options.  Even if no partial
execution options are specified, <B>xpatmaint</B> still writes the update directives to the
<I>pmt_dir</I> file after it has finished stage 1.
The <I>pmt_dir</I> directives file is only removed after stage 3 completes.
Should a machine crash occur after stage 2, it is only necessary to restore
the index and region files before re-running <B>xpatmaint</B> with the 
<B>-2</B> and <B>-3</B> options specified.
Should a machine crash occur during stage 3, only the region files would need
to be restored before re-running <B>xpatmaint</B> with the <B>-3</B> option specified.
<P>
After stage 2 is successfully completed, the <I>pmt_sv_dir</I> directive files
will be created. As long as the <I>pmt_sv_dir</I> is created successful,
the machine crash occur during stage 4, only the fast find index files would
need to be restored before re-running <B>xpatmaint</B> with the <B>-4</B> option specified.
<P>
The stage 5 will completely rebuild all fast regions specified either in
<I>main</I> database or in <I>append</I> database. Therefore, no file is needed to be restored
before re-running <B>xpatmaint</B> with the <B>-5</B> option specified.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DELETION PORTIONS FILE</H2>

The deletion portions file specifies the portions of the <I>main</I> database
that are to be removed.
The portions are specified by
pairs of start and end positions and these positions are inclusive.
The positions must be monotonically increasing and must not overlap.
Each pair of positions must be on a separate line.  Positions are 
1-based offsets into the text.
This means that the first character of the file is at position 1.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

122 345
790 930
3507 5603

</PRE>

</DL>

Text between offsets 122 and 345, 790 and 930, and 3507 and 5603 in the
<I>main</I> database will be deleted.
Note that the positions are monotonically increasing and do not overlap.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DISK REQUIREMENTS</H2>

In addition to the disk space necessary for the <I>main</I> and <I>append</I> databases,
<B>xpatmaint</B> requires disk space equal to the size of the <I>append</I> database text, index
(built using the index specifications from the <I>main</I>_<I>data_dictionary</I>), and region files.
Disk space for the <I>pmt_dir</I> update directives file must also be
available.  The size of this file is directly proportional to the number
of deletion portions plus approximately the size of the <I>append</I> text.  300 bytes are
required for each portion of text to be deleted.  For example, 10 deletions
will increase the size of the directives file by 3 KB.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MEMORY REQUIREMENTS</H2>

<B>xpatmaint</B> has the following memory requirements:
<BR>

1) approximately 5 times the size of the <I>append</I> text.  Note,
however, that only 3 times the
size of the <I>append</I> text need be available in core at a time - the rest may be
swapped out in virtual memory.
<BR>

2) 500 bytes per deletion portion.
<BR>

3) 32K of buffer space.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXECUTION TIME</H2>

The following times are the execution characteristics of <B>xpatmaint</B> running on a Sun
SPARCstation 2.  Before the first stage begins, a setup stage is performed.
The time required to perform the setup is related to the size of the <I>append</I> text.
The setup stage for a 1 MB <I>append</I> text typically requires about 20 seconds.
<P>
During stage 1, the scan rate for the <I>main</I> text is logarithmic in the size of
the <I>append</I> text but tends to level off when the size of the <I>append</I> text exceeds 2 MB.
Using the <B>-o</B> optimization option, a typical scan rate for a 1 MB <I>append</I> text
is 140 KB/sec.  So, stage 1 requires time equal to the size of the <I>main</I> text
divided by the effective scan rate.
<P>
Stage 2 merges the <I>append</I> index with the <I>main</I> index.  The rate at which this stage
progresses varies with the relative sizes of the <I>main</I> and <I>append</I> texts.  When
the <I>append</I> text is 10% the size of the <I>main</I> text, the processing rate is typically
300 KB/sec.  Stage 2 requires time equal to the size of the <I>main</I> index (not the
<I>main</I> index) divided by the effective processing rate.
<P>
Stage 3 merges the <I>append</I> region files with the <I>main</I> region files.  The time
required to do this depends on the total size of all the region files from
both databases but a typical processing rate is 400 KB/sec.
<P>
Stage 4 merges the <I>append</I> fast find index files with the <I>main</I> fast find index files.
The time required to do this depends on the size of
the fast find index files and the number of deleted text regions.
<P>
Stage 5 rebuilds the <I>append</I> fast region indices. The time required will be the
same as the time required to run <B>xpatfr</B> independently on each fast regions.
<P>
When all the above stages (excepted stage 4 and stage 5) are combined,
the overall processing rate
for the addition of an append text that is 1% the size of the main text,
on a Sun SPARCstation 2 is approximately 120 KB/sec in the size of the
main text.
If including stage 4, the speed will be approximately 40 KB/sec.
In addition, if including stage 5,
the speed will be futher decreased by the number of fast regions
need to be rebuilt.
<P>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

<P>

This example assumes that the <I>main</I> database is in the directory
/usr/database/main.  The database consists of the text (main_db),
the index (main_db.idx), the Data Dictionary (main_db.dd), and two region files
(main_db.rgn and custom.rgn).  There is also a deletion portions file
called main_delete.
<P>
The <I>append</I> text is 500 KB in size and is in the file
/usr/database/new_data/new.  The first step in merging the <I>append</I> text with
the <I>main</I> database is to build an <I>append</I> database.  This is done by going to the
/usr/database/new_data directory and running <B>xpatbld</B>.  <B>xpatbld</B> is given 1200
KB of memory to use - enough to index the 500 KB of text.
In the following steps,
note the use of full pathnames in the various file specifications:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<TT>% cd /usr/database/new_data
% xpatbld -m 1200k -t /usr/database/new_data/new \
    -o /usr/database/new_data/new</TT>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The region indices are built next, using a combination of <B>multirgn</B> and <B>xpatrgn</B>.  It is
assumed that a descriptive tagnames file with a `.tag' extension has been 
created for use by <B>multirgn</B>.  It is further assumed that the pattern for the
region called <I>Custom</I>, to be created using <B>xpatrgn</B>, is in the file
custom.ptn and that the <B>xpatrgn</B> generated region pointers will be placed
into a file called custom.rgn.  Note that while this example uses <B>multirgn</B> and
<B>xpatrgn</B>, <B>sgmlrgn</B> can also be used to create region files.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<TT>% multirgn -f new.dd tagnames.d
% xpatrgn new.dd \
   /usr/database/new_data/custom.rgn Custom &lt; custom.ptn</TT>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <I>append</I> database can now be merged with the <I>main</I> database.  The databases are
merged by going to the <I>main</I> database's directory and running <B>xpatmaint</B>.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<TT>% cd /usr/database/main
% xpatmaint -v -o -D main_db.dd -d main_delete \
                -a /usr/database/new_data/new.dd
          .
          .
      (various progress messages from xpatmaint)
          .
          .
      **** xpatmaint completed ****
%</TT>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

At this point, the <I>append</I> text has been added to the <I>main</I> database's text file
(main_db), an index has been built on the new text and has been merged
with the <I>main</I> database's index.  The regions in the <I>append</I> database's new.rgn
file have been merged with the regions in the <I>main</I> database's
main_db.rgn file.  The
regions in the <I>append</I> database's custom.rgn file have been merged with the
regions in the <I>main</I> database's custom.rgn file,
and the <I>main</I> database's Data Dictionary (main_db.dd) file has
been updated to reflect the new state of the database.  Note that the region
files are merged by region name,
and not on the basis of the region files themselves.
<P>
FINAL NOTE: For <B>xpatmaint</B> to run properly, it is important
that the region indices
created for the append database are proper <B>xpat</B> region indices.  
The validity of region files created by <B>multirgn</B>, <B>sgmlrgn</B>, or <B>xpatrgn</B> 
can be assumed.  However, if a custom program is used
to create the region files, then care should be taken to ensure that
faulty data does not produce incorrect region indices.
