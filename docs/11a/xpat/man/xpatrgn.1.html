<H2>NAME</H2>

<B>xpatrgn</B> - XPAT region file builder
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>xpatrgn</B> [ <B>-v</B> ] [ <B>-d</B> <I>region_description</I> ]
[ <B>-r</B> <I>region_name</I> ] [ <B>-p</B> <I>patterns_file</I> ]
<B>-o</B> <I>region_file</I>
<B>-D</B> <I>data_dictionary</I>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>xpatrgn</B> builds the <I>region_file</I> for the database specified
by <I>data_dictionary</I>, using the patterns specified in the <I>patterns-file</I>.
<B>xpatrgn</B> also updates the `Region' section for <I>region_name</I> in the
<I>data_dictionary</I>.  If <I>region_name</I> is not specified on the command
line, then <B>xpatrgn</B> uses the prefix of the <I>region_file</I> as the region name.
If the <B>-p</B> option is not specified, <B>xpatrgn</B> expects the region
patterns on its standard input (e.g., from previous programs
in a pipeline).
After the region is built, it is referred to in <B>xpat</B> as <I>region_name</I>.
Refer to the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+regions">regions</A></B>(5) man page for more information on the format of
the <I>region_file</I> that <B>xpatrgn</B> produces.
<P>

The region patterns in the <I>patterns_file</I>
consist of pairs of starting and ending strings, one pair per line.
<B>xpatrgn</B> will search for occurrences of these string pairs in the text 
and record their offsets in <I>region_file</I>.
Once a starting string has been found, <B>xpatrgn</B>
will search for the first occurrence of the corresponding ending string in
order to end the region.  Nested occurrences are ignored.
Regions begin on the first character of the starting string and end on the
last character of the ending string.  These positions may be modified
by adding or subtracting an integer value, as shown in the example below.
If the ending string of any pair is not given in the input, <B>xpatrgn</B> will
begin regions on occurrences of the starting string, and will end the
regions on the character
before the first character of the next region.
If the end of the text is reached in the middle of a region,
the program will record the location of the last character in the text 
as the end position of the last region.
<P>

<B>Note</B>: this algorithm is different than that used by <B>xpat</B>
to make regions during a search session.  Consider the text,
<P>


<PRE>
    ( a b ( c d ) ( d e f
</PRE>


<P>

and the region pattern,
<P>


<PRE>
     &quot;(&quot; &quot;)&quot;
</PRE>


(i.e., build regions between the `(' and `)' characters).
<B>xpatrgn</B> would build the regions as `( a b ( c d )' and
` ( d e f'.  <B>xpat</B>, on the other hand, would find all
the matches which could start a region and all the matches
which could end a region.  It would then take the nearest pairs.  
For the above text, <B>xpat</B> would record the single region,
` ( c d )'.  It would <I>not</I> record a region for
either `( a b ', or `( d e f'.
<P>

The special character sequences `\^' and `\$'
will match the first and last characters in the text, respectively.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
Specify verbose mode.  This option tells <B>xpatrgn</B> to print progress
messages to the standard output, as it builds the index.  By default,
<B>xpatrgn</B> works silently.
<DT><B>-d</B> <I>description_text</I><DD>
Specify the region description.  Each `Region' section in the Data Dictionary
contains a `Desc' field.  This field contains
a description of the region (which is used in Help
screens in user interfaces, among other things).  <B>xpatrgn</B> will place the
<I>description_text</I> in the `Desc' for the region <B>xpatrgn</B> is
building.
Note that if this text consists of more than one word (the normal case),
it should be surrounded by quotes.
<DT><B>-r</B> <I>region_name</I><DD>
Specify the region name.  By default, <B>xpatrgn</B> uses the prefix of the
<I>region_file</I> as the region name.  This option is useful if
the region name and the region filename are different.  Note
that if <I>region_name</I> contains spaces, you should surround
it with quotes.
<DT><B>-p</B> <I>patterns_file</I><DD>
Specify the region patterns file.  By default, <B>xpatrgn</B> expect the patterns
on the standard input.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

The input pattern,
<P>

<PRE>
      &quot;\n&quot;
</PRE>

<P>

creates regions that are located between newline characters.
Note that these regions will start at each newline character and
there will be no region created for the first line
(the text before the first newline).
<P>

The input pattern,
<P>

<PRE>
      &quot;\^&quot;
      &quot;\n&quot; + 1
</PRE>

<P>

creates a region for each line in the file, starting on the first
character in each line.  This pattern will also include
the first line in the file.
<P>

The input pattern,
<P>

<PRE>
     &quot;&lt;Headline&gt;&quot; +10 &quot;&lt;/Headline&gt;&quot; -11
</PRE>

<P>

creates regions between `&lt;Headline&gt;' and `&lt;/Headline&gt;'
tags, except that the actual regions begin on the first letter
after the `&lt;Headline&gt;' tag, and end on the last letter before
the `&lt;/Headline&gt;' tag.  This is different from the actions
of <B>multirgn</B>, which includes the tags.
<P>

The command,
<P>

<PRE>
     xpatrgn -p my_patrns.ptn -o Patrn1.rgn -D text.dd
</PRE>

<P>

builds a region for the database specified by the Data Dictionary, `text.dd'.
It uses the patterns specified in `my_ptrns.ptn' and puts
the index in the file `Patrn1.rgn'.  It names the region,
`Patrn1'.
<P>

The command,
<P>

<PRE>
     xpatrgn -v -d &quot;This is my pattern&quot; -r &quot;My Pattern&quot; -p my_patrns.ptn
     -o MyPat.rgn -D data.dd
</PRE>

<P>

builds a region for the database specified by the Data Dictionary, `data.dd'.
<B>xpatrgn</B> will print progress messages as it builds the index.  It will
record the description, `This is my pattern' in the Data Dictionary entry
for the region it builds.  It will name the region, `My Pattern'.
It will get the patterns from the file, `my_patrns.ptn'.  Finally,
it will place the index in the file, `MyPat.rgn'.
<P>

The command,
<P>

<PRE>
     ptrn_prog | xpatrgn -o Patrn1.rgn -D text.dd
</PRE>

<P>

builds a region called `Patrn1' for the database specified by
`text.dd'.  It will put the index in the file, `Patrn1.rgn'.
