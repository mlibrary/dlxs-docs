<H1>Command and Settings Documentation</H1>
<H2><A NAME="{CommandFile}"><CODE>{CommandFile}</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>{CommandFile</CODE> <VAR>string</VAR><CODE>}</CODE> 
<P>changes the file name used by <CODE>save.commands</CODE> and 
<CODE>exec</CODE> . </P>
<P>The <CODE>CommandFile</CODE> setting determines which file the 
<CODE>save.commands</CODE> command writes to and the <CODE>exec</CODE> command 
reads from. It has a default value of <CODE>xpat.cmd</CODE> . If the 
string begins with a numeral or contains blanks or non-alphanumeric characters, 
it must be enclosed within <CODE>double quote</CODE> marks. The file name must 
also conform to the file naming conventions of the host operating system. It can 
be changed at any time during a XPAT session and remains in effect until changed 
again or until the end of the session. The current value of 
<CODE>CommandFile</CODE> is displayed by the command <CODE>{Settings}</CODE> . 
</P>

<H3>Examples:</H3> 
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{CommandFile "/usr/new/output_file"}</CODE> </PRE>
<P>This changes the setting to the value <CODE>/usr/new/output_file</CODE> which any subsequent 
  <CODE>save.commands</CODE> command writes to and <CODE>exec</CODE> command 
  reads from. </P>

<H3>See also:</H3> 
<P><CODE>exec</CODE> , <CODE>save.commands</CODE> , <CODE>Settings</CODE> 
</P>

<H2><A NAME="comment"><CODE>comment</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>#</CODE> 
<P>marks the start of a comment. </P>
<P>The comment, that is the <CODE>#</CODE> and the rest of the line following 
the <CODE>#</CODE> , is ignored by XPAT. The comment can be placed on a line by 
itself or following a XPAT query. It is useful for annotating queries stored in a 
file to be processed in batch mode or to be read in by the <CODE>exec</CODE> 
command. The queries may be created externally or generated during a XPAT session 
and saved by <CODE>save.commands</CODE> for later use. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3> 
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>#</CODE> find all the Shakespearean quotations
&gt;&gt;  region Quote incl (region Author incl "shaks") 
</PRE>
<P>The line beginning with the <CODE>#</CODE> is ignored by XPAT. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  first = region "&lt;E&gt;" .. "&lt;/L&gt;"
<CODE>#</CODE> find first language </PRE>
<P>XPAT creates a new region set with this command. The rest of the line, 
  beginning with the <CODE>#</CODE> , is ignored. </P>

<H3>See also:</H3> 
<P><CODE>exec</CODE> , <CODE>save.commands</CODE> , <CODE>save.history</CODE> 
</P>



<H2><A NAME="{DefaultRegion}"><CODE>{DefaultRegion}</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>{DefaultRegion</CODE> <VAR>string</VAR><CODE>}</CODE> 
<P>determines which region set is the current default. </P>
<P>The <CODE>DefaultRegion</CODE> setting designates a special region set, known 
as the default region. The default region can be referred to as 
<CODE>region</CODE> without specifying the actual region name. The setting can 
be changed at any time during a XPAT session and remains in effect until it is 
changed again or until the end of the session. </P>
<P>If the string giving the setting value begins with a numeral or contains 
blanks or non-alphanumeric characters it must be enclosed within <CODE>double 
quote</CODE> marks. </P>
<P>Using the default region in a command, without having previously specified 
one, is illegal and results in the following message.</P>
<PRE>No information for region in the data dictionary</PRE>
<P>For convenience, a frequently used <CODE>DefaultRegion</CODE> setting can be 
defined within an <CODE>init</CODE> file whose location is given 
in the data dictionary file. The <CODE>init</CODE> file is read 
and executed by a XPAT session when it is started (see the data dictionary 
documentation for details).</P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region including "constitution" </PRE>
<P>The region set referred to in the example by <CODE>region</CODE> is the one designated by the 
  <CODE>DefaultRegion</CODE> setting. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{DefaultRegion HeadLine}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  region including constitution </PRE>
<P>The first line changes the <CODE>DefaultRegion</CODE> setting to the value 
  <CODE>HeadLine</CODE> . The command that follows uses the region 
  set <CODE>HeadLine</CODE> even though it is not specified. 
  </P>

<H2><A NAME="difference"><CODE>difference</CODE></A></H2>
<VAR>set1</VAR> <CODE>-</CODE> <VAR>set2</VAR> 
<P>removes members from a set. </P>
<P>The <CODE>difference</CODE> operator (<CODE>-</CODE> ) creates a new set 
containing the members of <VAR>set1</VAR> that are not members of 
<VAR>set2</VAR>. <VAR>Set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> can be either point sets or 
region sets. The new set is of the same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P>If either <VAR>set1</VAR> or <VAR>set2</VAR> is a region set, the first 
pointer delineating each region is used to determine if a member of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> also occurs in <VAR>set2</VAR>. Thus, for set arithmetic 
(difference, union and intersection) in XPAT, set members of a region set are 
considered to be equal if they start at the same location in the text. The end 
point of a region is ignored in such operations. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "to" <CODE>-</CODE> "to " <CODE>-</CODE> "to&lt;"
</PRE>
<P>Note that these operators are parsed left to right and can be combined 
  without bracketing. This query creates a point set that contains all the 
  matches to the prefix <CODE>to</CODE> excluding those to the 
  string <CODE>to</CODE> followed by a blank or a left angle 
  bracket. Assuming an index in which all punctuation has been mapped to blanks, 
  the result contains words starting with <CODE>to</CODE> ) but not 
  the word <CODE>to</CODE> .</P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  ("q" <CODE>-</CODE> "qu") within region HeadWord
</PRE>
<P>This query creates a point set. The point set includes all words located in 
  a Headword region that begin with <CODE>q</CODE> but not with 
  <CODE>qu</CODE> .</P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Story incl "music " <CODE>-</CODE> region
Story incl "art "</PRE>
<P>This query creates a region set. The region set is comprised of all Story 
  regions that include the string <CODE>music</CODE> but not the 
  string <CODE>art</CODE> .</P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Q <CODE>-</CODE> "&lt;Q&gt;&lt;D&gt;" </PRE>
<P>Assume that the regions described by <CODE>region Q</CODE> 
  all begin with the string <CODE>&lt;Q&gt;</CODE> . The above 
  query creates a region set of the members of <CODE>region 
  Q</CODE> that do not have the string <CODE>&lt;D&gt;</CODE> 
  immediately following the <CODE>&lt;Q&gt;</CODE> . 
</P>

<H3>See also:</H3> 
<P><CODE>intersection</CODE> , <CODE>union</CODE></P>

<H2><A NAME="done"><CODE>done</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>done</CODE> 
<P>terminates a XPAT session.</P>
<P>The <CODE>done</CODE> command ends the session and causes the XPAT process to 
exit. A message may be generated telling how much computer time has been used 
during the session. </P>

<H3>See also:</H3> 
<P><CODE>quit</CODE> , <CODE>stop</CODE></P>

<H2><A NAME="double quote"><CODE>double quote</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>"</CODE> <VAR>string</VAR><CODE>"</CODE> 
<P>allows the use of strings that include special characters. </P>
<P>Normally, XPAT interprets a sequence of characters as a string and searches 
the database for matches to it. However, there are certain types of strings that 
XPAT cannot recognize as search targets unless they are enclosed within 
<CODE>double quote</CODE> marks. The special strings are: strings which begin 
with a numeral, for example <CODE>2nd</CODE> ; strings which 
contain blanks or non-alphanumeric characters, for example <CODE>end of the year</CODE> or <CODE>&lt;Author&gt;Scott</CODE> ; and strings which are XPAT commands, 
for example <CODE>near</CODE> and <CODE>within</CODE> . In each case, a string that is not enclosed in 
<CODE>double quote</CODE> marks but should be will result in a syntax error or 
unexpected result. </P>
<P>Note that if numbers are not enclosed in <CODE>double quote</CODE> marks, 
they are interpreted as a reference to the number of a set previously calculated 
in the XPAT session. </P>
<P>A pair of quotes representing an empty string (<CODE>""</CODE> ) stands for 
the set of all <CODE>index points</CODE> in the text being searched. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "done "
&gt;&gt;  done </PRE>
<P>The first command creates a point set containing matches to the word <CODE>done</CODE> . The second command ends the XPAT session. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  19 within region Date 
&gt;&gt;  "19" within region Date </PRE>
<P>The first query finds those members of the previously calculated set, 
  identified by the number 19, that are within <CODE>region 
  Date</CODE> . The second query finds the matches to the string <CODE>19</CODE> within <CODE>region Date</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "" </PRE>
<P>This command produces a list of every point indexed in the text. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "_XPat_1" = "match this string " 
&gt;&gt;  "_XPat_OP1" = region "Region Set 5" 
&gt;&gt;  "_XPat_2" = *"_XPat_1" within *"_XPat_OP1" </PRE>
<P>The above sequence of commands might be produced by a program that accepts 
  input from a user and generates commands that are sent to XPAT. Since the names 
  contain non-alphanumeric data they must be bounded by quotation marks. 
  </P>

<P><CODE>index point</CODE> , <CODE>region</CODE> , <CODE>set name</CODE> , 
<CODE>string search</CODE></P>

<H2><A NAME="exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>exec</CODE> 
<P>reads a file into a XPAT session and executes the commands contained in the 
file. </P>
<P>The name of the file read by the <CODE>exec</CODE> command is determined by 
the value of the <CODE>CommandFile</CODE> setting. By default, the value is 
<CODE>xpat.cmd</CODE> but can be changed at any time during the XPAT 
session. </P>
<P>The <CODE>exec</CODE> command can be used to enter queries to a XPAT session. 
The queries, for example macro definitions, may be recorded in a file using an 
editor or saved in a file from a previous XPAT session using 
<CODE>save.commands</CODE> . </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{CommandFile "/usr/xpat/srch023.q"}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>exec</CODE> </PRE>
<P>The first command sets the name of the file to be read by any 
  <CODE>exec</CODE> command to <CODE>/usr/xpat/srch023.q</CODE> . 
  The second command reads the file <CODE>/usr/xpat/srch023.q</CODE> and executes the commands contained in 
  the file. </P>

<P><CODE>CommandFile</CODE></P>

<H2><A NAME="export"><CODE>export</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>export</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> 
<P>saves information about sets created in a XPAT session. </P>
<P><CODE>Export</CODE> writes a detailed description of the members of 
<VAR>set1</VAR>, created during a XPAT session, to a file. The description 
includes the type (region or point) of the set and sufficient information to 
recreate a copy of the set. The name of the file is determined by the value of 
the <CODE>ExportFile</CODE> setting. By default the file name is <CODE>xpat.exp</CODE> but can be changed during a session by using the 
command <CODE>ExportFile</CODE> . When <CODE>export</CODE> writes to the named 
file it writes over anything that may currently exist in the file. Assuming a 
default <CODE>ExportFile</CODE> setting of <CODE>xpat.exp</CODE> , 
the following message is given:</P>
<PRE>Exporting to xpat.exp.</PRE>

<P>The file may subsequently be read into a XPAT session by the 
<CODE>import</CODE> command. </P>
<P>If the saved set is a frequently used region set, it can be made available as 
a predefined region in future XPAT sessions by editing the data dictionary file 
and adding the appropriate information. If the new region set, containing 150 
regions, is named <CODE>newregion</CODE> and saved in the file 
<CODE>newregion_file</CODE> , the following lines, added to the 
data dictionary, would make it available to XPAT.</P><PRE>&lt;Region&gt;
 &lt;Name&gt;newregion&lt;/Name&gt;
 &lt;Desc&gt;This new region set describes ....&lt;/Desc&gt;
 &lt;File&gt;
  &lt;SysName&gt;newregion_file&lt;/SysName&gt;
  &lt;Offset&gt;0&lt;/Offset&gt;
 &lt;/File&gt;
 &lt;Count&gt;300&lt;/Count&gt;
 &lt;Type&gt;pairs&lt;/Type&gt;
&lt;/Region&gt;
</PRE>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "tax" near "increase" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>export</CODE> % </PRE>
<P>The first query creates a point set of the matches to the string <CODE>tax</CODE> when it is within the current <CODE>Proximity</CODE> 
  of the string <CODE>increase</CODE> . The second command writes 
  this point set to the file <CODE>xpat.exp</CODE> . The information 
  written to the file contains header information followed by details about each 
  element in the set. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  {ExportFile "v.exp"} 
&gt;&gt;  verse = region "&lt;V&gt;" .. "&lt;/V&gt;" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>export</CODE> *verse </PRE>
<P>The first line of the example changes the <CODE>ExportFile</CODE> setting 
  to <CODE>v.exp</CODE> . The second line creates a region set and 
  names it <CODE>verse</CODE> . The third command writes header 
  information and a description of each member of the <CODE>region 
  verse</CODE> to the file <CODE>v.exp</CODE> . </P>

<CODE>{ExportFile</CODE> <VAR>string</VAR><CODE>}</CODE> 
<P>changes the file name used by <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>import</CODE> . 
</P>
<P>The <CODE>ExportFile</CODE> setting determines the file written by the 
<CODE>export</CODE> command and read by the <CODE>import</CODE> command. It has 
a default value of <CODE>xpat.exp</CODE> . If the string begins with 
a numeral or contains blanks or non-alphanumeric characters, it must be enclosed 
within <CODE>double quote</CODE> marks. The file name must also conform to the 
file naming conventions of the host operating system. It can be changed at any 
time during a XPAT session and remains in effect until it is changed again or 
until the end of the session. The current value of the <CODE>ExportFile</CODE> 
setting is displayed by the command <CODE>{Settings}</CODE> . </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{ExportFile "/usr/new/export_file"}</CODE> 
</PRE>
<P>This changes the value of the setting so that any subsequent 
  <CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>import</CODE> command utilizes the file <CODE>/usr/new/export_file</CODE> . </P>

<H2><A NAME="fby"><CODE>fby</CODE></A></H2>
<VAR>set1</VAR> <CODE>fby</CODE> <VAR>set2</VAR> 
<P>finds members of sets that occur close to each other in a specified order. 
</P>
<P><CODE>Fby</CODE> (followed by) creates a set containing those members of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> that have one or more members of <VAR>set2</VAR> within a 
specified number of characters to their right . <VAR>Set1</VAR> and 
<VAR>set2</VAR> may be either point sets or region sets. The new set is of the 
same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P>The distance between members of the two sets is calculated by counting the 
number of characters in the text from the first character of a member of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> to the first character of a member of <VAR>set2</VAR>. The 
measure used to determine <CODE>closeness</CODE> is the value of 
the <CODE>Proximity</CODE> setting which has a default value of 80 characters. 
This can be changed for all subsequent uses of <CODE>fby</CODE> by changing the 
<CODE>Proximity</CODE> setting, or it can be changed for an individual use of 
<CODE>fby</CODE> by using a modifier attached to the command. The form of the 
modifier is a period followed by a number representing the maximum distance (in 
characters).</P>
<P>If either <VAR>set1</VAR> or <VAR>set2</VAR> is a region set, the first of 
the two pointers delineating the region is used to determine the distance 
between the set members. </P>
<P>Multiple <CODE>fby</CODE> commands are not parsed left to right. A command of 
the form </P><PRE>       set1 <CODE>fby</CODE> set2 <CODE>fby</CODE> set3</PRE>
<P>is handled as if parenthesized as follows: </P><PRE>       set1 <CODE>fby</CODE> (set2 <CODE>fby</CODE> set3)</PRE>
<P>The command <CODE>not fby</CODE> creates a set containing the members of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> that are <CODE>not</CODE> within the specified distance to the 
left of any member of <VAR>set2</VAR>. </P><PRE>       set1 <CODE>not fby</CODE> (set2 <CODE>fby</CODE> set3)</PRE>
<P>is the same as </P><PRE>       set1 - (set1 <CODE>fby</CODE> (set2 <CODE>fby</CODE> set3))</PRE>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "law " <CODE>fby</CODE> "order " </PRE>
<P>Assuming a <CODE>Proximity</CODE> of 80, this query creates a point set 
  containing the matches to <CODE>law</CODE> with one or more 
  matches to <CODE>order</CODE> within 80 characters to their 
  right, counting from the <CODE>l</CODE> in <CODE>law</CODE> to the <CODE>o</CODE> in <CODE>order</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Title <CODE>fby.30</CODE> region Author
</PRE>
<P>This query creates a region set containing the members of the set <CODE>region Title</CODE> that have one or more members in the set 
  <CODE>region Author</CODE> within 30 characters to the right. 
  The distance is measured as the number of characters from the first character 
  of a Title region to the first character of an Author region. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "law " <CODE>not fby</CODE> "order " </PRE>
<P>This query creates a point set containing the matches to <CODE>law</CODE> that do not have a match to <CODE>order 
 </CODE> within 80 characters to the right, calculating the distance as in the 
  first example. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "law " <CODE>not fby.30</CODE> "order " </PRE>
<P>This query creates a point set containing the matches to <CODE>law</CODE> that do not have a match to <CODE>order 
 </CODE> within 30 characters to the right. </P>

<H2><A NAME="first"><CODE>first</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>first</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> 
<P>finds a specific number of contiguous members from the start of a set. </P>
<P><CODE>First</CODE> creates a set of a specified size which is comprised of 
members from the beginning of <VAR>set1</VAR>. The members of the new set are in 
the order they appear in <VAR>set1</VAR>. <VAR>Set1</VAR> may be either a region 
set or a point set. The new set is of the same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P>The operation of the <CODE>first</CODE> command involves the set member 
counter that keeps track of the selected members, the identification of the size 
of the requested set, and the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting that determines 
which members are in the new set. </P>
<P><CODE>First</CODE> selects members from the beginning of a set. The ordering 
of a set, and hence which members occur at the beginning, is controlled by the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting. If the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>Alpha</CODE> , the set is ordered alphabetically. If the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>Occur</CODE> or <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> , the set is ordered according to occurrence in 
the text. If the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , the set order is the current one which may be either 
alphabetic or occurrence order. </P>
<P>Each set that is used with a <CODE>first</CODE> , <CODE>next</CODE> or 
<CODE>~nextemp</CODE> command has a cursor (set member counter) associated with 
it. The cursor indicates the location in <VAR>set1</VAR> at which to start 
selecting members for the set being created. Each <CODE>first</CODE> command 
resets the cursor so members for the new set are chosen from the beginning of 
<VAR>set1</VAR>. On completion of the <CODE>first</CODE> command the cursor is 
updated to point at the beginning of the next set. Note, when the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting changes and the set ordering is changed, the 
cursor is reset to the beginning of <VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P>The size of the set created is determined by the value of 
<CODE>SampleSize</CODE> which has a default value of 10. If the size of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> is less than <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> then the new set created is 
the same size as <VAR>set1</VAR>. Changing the <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> setting 
affects all subsequent uses of <CODE>first</CODE> during the current session. 
For an individual use of the command, the size of the new set can be specified 
by using a modifier attached to the <CODE>first</CODE> command. This modifier is 
in the form of a period followed by a numeric value giving the desired set size. 
</P>
<P>The <CODE>first</CODE> command can be used by itself or with the 
<CODE>pr</CODE> , <CODE>save</CODE> or <CODE>export</CODE> commands. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  {SampleSize 40} 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>first</CODE> 5 </PRE>
<P>The first line changes the <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> setting to 40 and the 
  second line creates a set that contains the first 40 members of set number 5 
  created earlier in the XPAT session. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>first</CODE> .10 "the best of " </PRE>
<P>This line creates a set containing the first 10 members in the set of 
  matches to the phrase <CODE>the best of</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>first</CODE> .0 3 </PRE>
<P>This query resets the cursor to the first member of set number

<CODE>history</CODE> 
<P>displays the record of the current XPAT session. </P>
<P>Information about each set created during the XPAT session is recorded in a 
history list. For each of the sets, <CODE>history</CODE> displays a set number, 
the number of members in the set and the query that produced the set. Sets 
created during the current session can be accessed by referring to the number of 
the set in the history list. The results of <CODE>pr</CODE> , <CODE>save</CODE> , 
<CODE>Settings</CODE> , <CODE>{ }</CODE> , and certain tilde (<CODE>~</CODE> ) 
commands do not appear in this list since no sets are produced by these 
commands. </P>
<P>As the entire history list may become quite long, it is useful to be able to 
view only a part of the list. The <CODE>History</CODE> setting determines what 
portion of the history list is displayed by the <CODE>history</CODE> command. 
The <CODE>History</CODE> setting has a default value of 0. This indicates that 
the entire history list is to be displayed. When set to an integer <VAR>n</VAR> 
(any integer greater than zero) the final <VAR>n</VAR> elements in the history 
list are displayed by any subsequent use of the <CODE>history</CODE> command 
during the session. </P>
<P>The items listed can also be changed for an individual use of the 
<CODE>history</CODE> command. Modifiers may be attached to the 
<CODE>history</CODE> command to request that a certain number of items and that 
a particular portion of the list be displayed. </P>
<P>The first modifier, in the form of a period followed by a number, indicates 
where in the history list to begin the display. A positive integer <VAR>p</VAR> 
requests that the display start at the <VAR>p</VAR>th item from the start of the 
history list. A negative integer <VAR>p</VAR> requests that the display start at 
the <VAR>p</VAR>th item from the end of the history list. The number of items 
displayed is the value of the <CODE>History</CODE> setting. </P>
<P>The number of items displayed can also be changed for an individual use of 
the <CODE>history</CODE> command by using a second modifier attached to an 
already modified <CODE>history</CODE> command. This second modifier is also in 
the form of a period followed by a number giving the number of items to be 
displayed. </P>
<P>The default maximum size of the history list is 300 items. If more than 300 
sets are created the last 300 sets created during this XPAT session are retained 
in the list. This maximum size can be altered by a command line parameter when 
starting a XPAT session. </P>
<P>Note that a set can be removed from the history list by the 
<CODE>~free</CODE> command. </P>

  the five final sets in the history list. The second command shows information 
  about the final five sets in the history list. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>history.3</CODE> </PRE>
<P>This use of the <CODE>history</CODE> command gives information about the

<P>The <CODE>History</CODE> setting determines the number of items displayed by 
the <CODE>history</CODE> command. Note that the setting may be overridden and 
the number of items displayed determined by a modifier for an individual use of

<VAR>Set1</VAR> must be a region set. <VAR>Set2</VAR> may be either a point set

<H2><A NAME="index_point"><CODE>index point</CODE></A></H2>
<P>XPAT views the entire text as one long string. In contrast to 
traditional text indices, which deal with words, XPAT indexes strings. The 
indexed strings extend from each <CODE>index point</CODE> to the end of the 
text.</P>
<P>The XPAT index is made up of the starting points of each string. The index 
points make up the possible match points for a string search. Parameters set 
when the index is built determine which strings are in the index. The parameters 
specify patterns in the text that define the beginnings of strings to be 
indexed. For example, one pattern could specify that every character in the text 
is to be indexed, while another pattern could specify that each printable 
character following a blank is to be indexed. </P>
<P>When the index is created, two additional settings can alter how XPAT sees the 
text. <em>Character mappings</em> cause XPAT to see certain characters as 
equivalent to other characters. For example, all upper case letters may be 
mapped to lower case letters so that XPAT does not distinguish between upper and 
lower case when searching for a string. Also, some words may be designated as 
<em>stopwords</em>. XPAT views the text as if these words are not there. XPAT 
ignores strings in the text that start at an index point and match the given 
stopword strings followed by a blank after the character mappings have been 
applied. The character mappings also affect the strings chosen to be index 
points. For example, if a <CODE>&gt;</CODE> is mapped to a blank 
and if the index points are defined as blanks followed by printable characters, 
in the text <CODE>...&lt;tag&gt;wisdom...</CODE> the <CODE>w</CODE> in the string <CODE>wisdom</CODE> is an 
index point. Text with character mappings applied and stopwords removed is 
referred to as <em>converted text</em>. </P>
<P>When searching for a given string, a match is found if the given string 
(after having the character mappings applied to it and the stopwords removed) is 
the same as the converted text that begins one of the indexed strings.</P>

<P>When XPAT is operating in <CODE>quiet mode</CODE> with labels requested, any 
set displayed by a <CODE>pr</CODE> or <CODE>save</CODE> command shows the label 
string preceding the numeric value of the text offset. This can be used to 
identify which database the information is from. In a XPAT session, if a value 
for <CODE>Label</CODE> has not been set by this command, the default value used 
is the name of the data dictionary. The label string must begin with an

<H2><A NAME="macro"><CODE>macro</CODE></A></H2>
<P>The <CODE>macro</CODE> capability facilitates the use of 
frequently used sequences of XPAT commands. </P>
<P>A macro can be defined in a XPAT session and be available only for the 
duration of that session, or a macro can be created externally and read into any 
XPAT session by an <CODE>exec</CODE> command or during initialization. </P>
<P>The definition of a macro (here called <CODE>name</CODE> ) 
begins with the following: <CODE>name = macro</CODE></P>
<P>After this line the system prompt changes from <CODE>&gt;&gt;</CODE> to <CODE>||</CODE> for the duration 
of the macro definition. The body of the macro may begin on the same line or on 
a subsequent line. XPAT interprets anything immediately following the word 
<CODE>macro</CODE> , that is not a blank or new line, as the beginning of the 
macro definition. The body of the macro may contain arguments. The 
<VAR>n</VAR>th argument to the macro is identified within the macro definition 
by the string <CODE>$n$</CODE> . Any sets that are created by the 
macro may also be used in its definition. The string <CODE>*n*</CODE> refers to the <VAR>n</VAR>th set created within the 
macro. The end of the macro definition is indicated by a <CODE>@</CODE> . After the <CODE>@</CODE> the system prompt 
returns to the form <CODE>&gt;&gt;</CODE> . </P>
<P>References to other macros may be used within the definition of a macro. If 
the macro contains more than one XPAT query, they can be put on separate lines or 
on the same line with the queries separated by a semi-colon. The body of the 
macro is not checked for syntax errors when it is defined. Any errors are 
reported when the macro is used. </P>
<P>The macro is invoked by the following call: </P><CODE>name(arg1,arg2..)</CODE> 
<P>If the number of arguments in the macro call is less than the number in the 
macro definition a syntax error is reported. If it is greater, the extra 
arguments are ignored.</P>
<P>Each argument consists of all the text occurring between argument delimiters: 
parentheses and commas. That is, if a macro takes three arguments - <CODE>(arg1,arg2,arg3)</CODE> - <CODE>arg1</CODE> consists 
of the text between the opening parenthesis and the first comma, <CODE>arg2</CODE> consists of the text between the first and second 
comma, and <CODE>arg3</CODE> consists of the text between the 
second comma and closing parenthesis. If a macro takes only one argument - <CODE>(arg1)</CODE> - the parentheses are the argument delimiters. Note 
that any spaces entered with an argument string will be included with the 
parameter substitution which is unlikely to be the intent of the user. To avoid 
unexpected results, enter only the <em>exact</em> text that you wish to be 
substituted in the arguments of the macro call. Also note that macros may have 
no arguments. </P>
<P>When the macro is invoked, the invocation is replaced by an exact copy of the 
body of the macro with the arguments substituted for the formal parameters. This 
means that the macro can be used within other XPAT queries. This may require that 
the macro definition have the closing <CODE>@</CODE> on the same 
line as the final line of the body of the macro definition to avoid introducing 
an unwanted new-line character. </P>
<P>If improperly used, macros that produce multiple sets and are used within 
other queries may cause more than one syntax error to be reported. Care must be 
taken with bracketing in order to ensure that the results reflect what was 
actually intended. </P>
<P>A macro can be redefined during a XPAT session. When the macro is redefined, 
the previous definition of the macro is displayed following the first new line 
entered after the word <CODE>macro</CODE> . The format of this previous 
definition consists of the macro name followed by a colon, followed by the body 
of the macro on subsequent lines. </P>
<P>For convenience, macros that are used frequently can be defined within an 
<em>init file</em> whose location is given in the data dictionary file. The init 
file is read and executed by a XPAT session when it is initially started. (See 
the data dictionary documentation for details.) </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  word = macro 
 ||  ( "$1$ " + "$1$&lt;" + "$1$-" ) @ 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>word(pad)</CODE> within *definitions </PRE>
<P>This macro is used with text that contains tags that start with a <CODE>&lt;</CODE> and where the tags may follow text without blanks 
  appearing before the tag. The macro defines a word as a string of characters 
  followed by a blank, <CODE>&lt;</CODE> , or <CODE>-</CODE> (in this definition an index that has all punctuation 
  mapped to a blank is assumed). Since the macro definition has the <CODE>@</CODE> sign on the same line as the body of the definition, 
  the macro can be used within a more complicated query as shown. Note the 
  brackets included in the macro definition. The example assumes that there is a 
  region <CODE>definition</CODE> and finds all occurrences of 
  <CODE>pad</CODE> , as a word, inside one of these regions. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  both = macro 
 ||  region $1$ 
 ||  *1* including $2$ 
 ||  *2* including $3$ 
 ||  @ 
&gt;&gt; 
<CODE>both(Line</CODE> ,<CODE>"juliet"</CODE> ,<CODE>"romeo")</CODE> 
</PRE>
<P>With the macro defined here, the members of a predefined region set which 
  contain both of two given strings are found. In the macro call above, the 
  macro is applied to a database of Shakespearean texts in order to find the 
  members of the predefined region set named <CODE>Line</CODE> 
  containing references to both <CODE>romeo</CODE> and <CODE>juliet</CODE> . The definition of this macro returns more than 
  one set. It also has the <CODE>@</CODE> on the line following 
  the body and thus could not be used within another query. The resulting output 
  from XPAT showing the three sets produced by the macro would appear as below:</P>
<PRE>  16: 128794 matches
  17: 214 matches
  18: 25 matches</PRE>

<P>A set which has been named can be referred to either by that name or its set 
number. <VAR>Set1</VAR> can be either a point set or a region set. </P>
<P>A <VAR>name</VAR> that starts with a letter and contains only letters and 
numbers does not need to be enclosed within <CODE>double quote</CODE> marks. 
However, if the <VAR>name</VAR> contains special characters (blanks or 
non-alphanumeric characters), or does not start with a letter, it must be 
enclosed within <CODE>double quote</CODE> marks both in the assignment statement 
and in subsequent use. </P>
<P>To use the name in a query it must be preceded by an asterisk 
(<CODE>*</CODE> ). Without the asterisk (<CODE>*</CODE> ), XPAT interprets the name 
as a string rather than as the name of a set. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  UK <CODE>=</CODE> "U.K."+"Britain"+"Great Brit"+"United King" 
&gt;&gt;  region Headline including *UK </PRE>
<P>The first line assigns the name <CODE>UK</CODE> to a set of 
  matches to four alternate ways of referring to the United Kingdom. The second 
  line finds Headline regions that contain any of the matches. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "min_hiring" <CODE>=</CODE> region Minutes incl ("hiring" near "policy") 
&gt;&gt;  region Attendees within *"min_hiring" </PRE>
<P>The first line of the example assigns the name <CODE>min_hiring</CODE> to Minutes regions that include matches to 
  <CODE>hiring</CODE> appearing close to matches to <CODE>policy</CODE> . The second line finds the Attendees regions that

<H2><A NAME="near"><CODE>near</CODE></A></H2>
<VAR>set1</VAR> <CODE>near</CODE> <VAR>set2</VAR> 
<P>finds members of sets that are close to each other. </P>
<P><CODE>Near</CODE> creates a set containing the members of <VAR>set1</VAR> 
that are within a specified number of characters before or after one or more 
members of <VAR>set2</VAR>. <VAR>Set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> may be either 
point sets or region sets. The new set is of the same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. 
</P>
<P>The distance between members of the two sets is calculated by counting the 
number of characters in the text between the first character of a member of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> and the first character of a member of <VAR>set2</VAR>. The 
measure used to determine <CODE>closeness</CODE> is the value of 
the <CODE>Proximity</CODE> setting which has a default value of 80 characters. 
The value can be changed for all subsequent uses of <CODE>near</CODE> by 
changing the <CODE>Proximity</CODE> setting, or it can be changed for an 
individual use of <CODE>near</CODE> by using a modifier attached to the command. 
The form of the modifier is a period followed by a number representing the 
maximum distance (in characters). </P>
<P>If either <VAR>set1</VAR> or <VAR>set2</VAR> is a region set, the first of 
the two pointers describing the region is used in finding the distance between 
the members of the sets. </P>
<P>Multiple <CODE>near</CODE> commands are not parsed left to right. A command 
of the form </P><PRE>       set1 <CODE>near</CODE> set2 <CODE>near</CODE> set3 </PRE>
<P>is handled as if parenthesized as follows: </P><PRE>       set1 <CODE>near</CODE> (set2 <CODE>near</CODE> set3)</PRE>
<P>The command <CODE>not near</CODE> creates a set containing those members of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> that are <CODE>not</CODE> within the specified distance of any 
member of <VAR>set2</VAR>. </P><PRE> set1 <CODE>not near</CODE> set2 </PRE>
<P>is the same as </P><PRE> set1 - (set1 <CODE>near</CODE> set2) </PRE>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "love " <CODE>near</CODE> "hate " </PRE>
<P>Assuming a <CODE>Proximity</CODE> of 80, this query creates a point set 
  containing those matches to <CODE>love</CODE> that are within 80 
  characters of matches to <CODE>hate</CODE> , counting from the 
  <CODE>l</CODE> in <CODE>love</CODE> to the <CODE>h</CODE> in <CODE>hate</CODE> . The string <CODE>hate</CODE> can occur before or after <CODE>love 
 </CODE> in the text. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Title <CODE>near.30</CODE> region Author
</PRE>
<P>This query creates a region set containing the members of <CODE>region Title</CODE> that are within 30 characters of one or more 
  members of <CODE>region Author</CODE> . In this case the distance 
  is measured as the number of characters between the first character of a Title 
  region and the first character of an Author region. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "love " <CODE>not near</CODE> "hate " </PRE>
<P>This query creates a point set containing those matches to <CODE>love</CODE> that do not occur within 80 characters of a match to 
  <CODE>hate</CODE> calculating the distance as in the first 
  example. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "love " <CODE>not near.30</CODE> "hate " </PRE>
<P>This query creates a point set containing the matches to <CODE>love</CODE> that do not occur within 30 characters of a match to

<P><CODE>Next</CODE> creates a set of a specified size containing the members of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> that start at the current cursor position associated with this 
set. The cursor position is determined by a previous <CODE>first</CODE> or 
<CODE>next</CODE> command applied to <VAR>set1</VAR>. The members of the new set

region set or a point set. The new set is of the same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. 
</P>
<P>The operation of the <CODE>next</CODE> command depends on the set order 
established by the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting. If the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE>

<P>Each set that is used with a <CODE>first</CODE> , <CODE>next</CODE> or 
<CODE>~nextemp</CODE> command has a cursor (set member counter) associated with 
it. The cursor indicates the location in <VAR>set1</VAR> at which to begin 
selection for the set being created. On completion of the <CODE>next</CODE> 
command the cursor is updated to point at the beginning of the next set. Note, 
when the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting changes and the set ordering is changed, 
the cursor is reset to the first element. </P>
<P>The size of the set created is determined by the value of 
<CODE>SampleSize</CODE> which has a default value of 10. If the size of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> is less than <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> , then the new set created 
is the same size as <VAR>set1</VAR>. Changing the <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> 
affects all subsequent uses of <CODE>next</CODE> during the current session. For 
an individual use of the command, the size of the new set can be specified by 
using a modifier attached to the <CODE>next</CODE> command. The modifier is in 
the form of a period followed by a numeric value giving the desired set size. 
</P>
<P>The <CODE>next</CODE> command can be used by itself or with the 
<CODE>pr</CODE> , <CODE>save</CODE> or <CODE>export</CODE> commands. Note that 
<CODE>next</CODE> may only be used in conjunction with these commands.

<PRE>&gt;&gt;  {SampleSize 40} 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>first</CODE> .0 5 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>next</CODE> 5 </PRE>
<P>The first line of the example changes the <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> setting 
  to 40. The <CODE>first</CODE> command resets the cursor associated with set 
  number 5 to the first member of the set and creates a set of size 0 (thereby 
  leaving the cursor at the first member). The third line creates a set that 
  contains the first 40 members of set number 5. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>next</CODE> .10 5 </PRE>
<P>If this command follows the previous example, a set of ten members is

<P>The number in the square brackets is a logical position in the text and need

the text XPAT gives the message</P>
<PRE>Error: Input number too large.</PRE>

<P>Note that the new set is a point set with only one member. </P>
<P>The second form of the command, shown above, uses offsets that are produced 
when XPAT is operating in quiet mode and using labels. In this form, in order to 
produce correct results, the label string must be the current value of the 
setting <CODE>Label</CODE> . When the label is different from the current 
<CODE>Label</CODE> setting the resulting set has size 0. </P>

<P>This query uses an offset in the form produced by XPAT in quiet mode (having

<CODE>pr</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> 
<P>displays contents of XPAT sets. </P>
<P><CODE>Pr</CODE> displays each member of <VAR>set1</VAR> with surrounding 
context. A modifier can be attached to the <CODE>pr</CODE> command in order to 
control the context exactly. <VAR>Set1</VAR> can be any region set or point set. 
If <VAR>set1</VAR> is a region set, the first of the pair of points describing 
each region in the text is displayed by the <CODE>pr</CODE> command. If no 
<VAR>set1</VAR> is given, the operand for the command is the most recent set 
created in the session. </P>
<P>For each member in the given set, the output is in the form of an integer 
giving the offset of the set member in the text file, followed by a comma, a 
blank, two periods and then the characters surrounding the set member. The first 
character in the database is considered to be offset 1. The order in which the 
set is displayed depends on the current <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting. </P>
<P>With no modifier, <CODE>pr</CODE> prints a line of text for each element in 
<VAR>set1</VAR>. The <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> and <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> 
settings determine the content of the line printed. With the default settings, 
the printed text is 64 characters in length of which 14 precede the match point. 
The number of characters displayed to the left of the match point can be altered 
by changing the <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> . The total number of characters printed 
can be altered by changing the <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> setting.</P>
<P>The total number of characters to be displayed can be set, for a single 
instance of the command, by using a numeric modifier attached to the 
<CODE>pr</CODE> . The modifier is in the form of a period followed by a number 
giving the total number of characters to be displayed. The left context that is 
displayed is still determined by the value of the <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> 
setting. </P>
<P>The second form the modifier can have is a period followed by the string 
<CODE>region</CODE> . When the modifier <CODE>.region</CODE> is used, the output 
text starts at the match point and continues to the end of the default region in 
which the match point occurs. If the match point is not within the default 
region, no output is displayed for the match point. </P>
<P>The second form of the modifier can be refined to request that the text 
displayed is a region other than the default region. An additional modifier 
specifying a defined region set can be attached to the already modified 
<CODE>pr</CODE> command (i.e. to the <CODE>pr.region</CODE> ). The additional 
modifier can specify the region in one of three ways: a string giving the name 
of a predefined region, the number of a region set created in the XPAT session, 
or a string preceded by an asterisk (<CODE>*</CODE> ) referring to a named region 
set defined in the XPAT session (see the examples below). As with the form 
<CODE>pr.region</CODE> , described above, this use results in the displayed text 
starting at the match point with no left context and continuing to the end of 
the region. When the match point is not contained in the designated region set, 
no output is displayed. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>"Kipling"</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>pr</CODE> </PRE>
<P>This command displays a line of context for each member of the previously 
  calculated set. Assuming the <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> and 
  <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> still have the default values, each line will contain 
  64 characters of which 14 will be before the match point. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  {PrintLength 300} 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>pr</CODE> "my dear Watson" </PRE>
<P>As with the previous example, this command prints a line of context for 
  each member in the point set matching the string <CODE>my dear

</P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>pr.200</CODE> shift.-100 ("city" near "oxford")
</PRE>
<P>This command prints a line of 200 characters for each member in the set of 
  matches to the string <CODE>city</CODE> when it appears near the 
  string <CODE>oxford</CODE> . Since the match points in this set 
  have been shifted 100 characters to the left the displayed text actually

<P>The first query finds the members of the <CODE>default region</CODE> (in 
  this example they might be dictionary entries) that contain EQ regions which 
  are in the period from 1980 to 1986. The second command prints these entries. 
  After the offset, comma, blank and two periods, the displayed text starts at 
  the match point which is at the beginning of the default region, and continues 
  to the end of the default region. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Quote including ("univ" near "waterloo")

&gt;&gt;  <CODE>pr.region.Quote</CODE> </PRE>
<P>The first query finds the Quote regions which contain the string <CODE>univ</CODE> occurring near the string <CODE>waterloo</CODE> . The second command displays these regions. The 
  output consists of an offset, comma, blank, two periods and the text starting 
  at the beginning of the Quote region and continuing to the end of the Quote 
  region. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>pr.region.5</CODE> "law" fby "order" </PRE>
<P>This command displays data from the set of matches to the string <CODE>law</CODE> when followed by <CODE>order</CODE> . 
  The text that is printed starts at the matches to the string <CODE>law</CODE> and continues to the end of the regions which contain 
  the match point. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  *verse including "faith, hope, charity" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>pr.region.*verse</CODE> </PRE>
<P>The first query finds the regions that contain the string <CODE>faith, hope, charity</CODE> occurring in the set that has been 
  created and named <CODE>verse</CODE> during the XPAT session. For 
  each of the members in this region set, the second command prints information 
  starting at the beginning of the region and continuing to the end of the 
  region described by <CODE>*verse</CODE> . </P>

<H2><A NAME="{PrintLength}"><CODE>{PrintLength}</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>{PrintLength</CODE> <VAR>number</VAR><CODE>}</CODE> 
<P>specifies how many characters of text are displayed. </P>
<P>By default, when the members of a set are displayed with the <CODE>pr</CODE> 
command or written to a file by the <CODE>save</CODE> command, each member 
contains 64 characters of context, 14 to the left of the match point, the match 
point itself, and 49 to the right. This setting may be overridden so that the 
number of characters processed is determined by a modifier for an individual use 
of the <CODE>pr</CODE> or <CODE>save</CODE> commands. The 
<CODE>PrintLength</CODE> setting determines the total number of characters 
processed and thus affects the number of characters shown to the right of the 
match point. The number of characters to the left of the match point is 
determined by the <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> setting. </P>
<P>The setting can be changed at any time during a XPAT session and remains in 
effect until changed again or until the end of the session. The current value of 
the <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> setting is displayed by the command 
<CODE>{Settings}</CODE> . </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{PrintLength 100}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  pr ("Yukon" near ("B.C." + "British Columbia"))
</PRE>
<P>This changes the setting to the value 100 so that any subsequent 
  <CODE>pr</CODE> or <CODE>save</CODE> command produces text 100 characters in 
  length. The set displayed has 14 characters to the left of the match point and 
  85 characters to the right, assuming a default value of 14 characters for left 
  context. </P>

<H2><A NAME="{Proximity}"><CODE>{Proximity}</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>{Proximity</CODE> <VAR>number</VAR><CODE>}</CODE> 
<P>specifies the measure of closeness for the <CODE>near</CODE> and 
<CODE>fby</CODE> commands. </P>
<P>The <CODE>Proximity</CODE> default for the <CODE>fby</CODE> and 
<CODE>near</CODE> commands is 80 characters. That is, a match point of a member 
of <VAR>set1</VAR> must be within 80 characters of a match point of a member of 
<VAR>set2</VAR> to be included in a new set created by the <CODE>near</CODE> and 
<CODE>fby</CODE> commands.</P>
<P>The <CODE>Proximity</CODE> setting may be overridden for an individual use of 
the <CODE>fby</CODE> and <CODE>near</CODE> commands by appending a modifier to 
the command. </P>
<P>The <CODE>Proximity</CODE> setting can also be changed at any time during a 
XPAT session and remains in effect until changed again or until the end of the 
session (see example below). The current value of the <CODE>Proximity</CODE> 
setting is displayed by the command <CODE>{Settings}</CODE> . </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{Proximity 200}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt; "Canada" near ("U.S." + "United States" + "the States") </PRE>
<P>The first line of the example changes the <CODE>Proximity</CODE> setting to 
  the value 200 so that any subsequent <CODE>Proximity</CODE> commands use this 
  value. In the query, XPAT finds the occurrences of the string <CODE>Canada</CODE> that occur within 200 characters either to the 
  left or right of members of the set produced by the union of the sets matching 
  the strings <CODE>U.S.</CODE> , <CODE>United

<CODE>~qnum</CODE> 
<P>outputs a query number. </P>
<P>The <CODE>~qnum</CODE> command operates in both standard and quiet mode. In 
standard mode, the number of the next query is output. In quiet mode, the 
information is tagged and the number of the next query is contained within 
<VAR>&lt;Qnum&gt;</VAR> tags. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "testing" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>~qnum</CODE> </PRE>
<P>If <CODE>testing</CODE> is the first query in the XPAT 
  session, the output from the <CODE>~qnum</CODE> command is the set number 2. 
  In quiet mode, this appears as the string <CODE>&lt;Qnum&gt;2&lt;/Qnum&gt;</CODE> . </P>

<P><CODE>{QuietOff}</CODE></P>
<P>changes the mode of operation of XPAT. <CODE>{QuietOn}</CODE> causes XPAT to 
operate in quiet mode. <CODE>{QuietOff}</CODE> causes XPAT to revert to standard 
(non-quiet) mode. </P>
<P>Each of the four arguments to <CODE>QuietOn</CODE> is optional and may appear 
in any order. When an argument is present in a <CODE>QuietOn</CODE> command, the 
corresponding setting is turned on. Conversely, when an argument is not present 
in a <CODE>QuietOn</CODE> command, the corresponding setting is turned off. 
Settings are not carried forward from one <CODE>QuietOn</CODE> command to the 
next but are reset with each <CODE>QuietOn</CODE> command.</P>
<P>All XPAT commands that create sets operate the same way in quiet mode and in 
standard mode. However, the output generated by XPAT is different in the two 
modes. No prompt or newline appears when XPAT is operating in quiet mode. In 
addition, the output from XPAT in quiet mode is in a tagged format. </P>
<P>In standard mode, when a command or query creates a new set, a set number and 
the number of matches is output. In quiet mode, the tagged output contains the 
number of matches within <VAR>&lt;SSize&gt;</VAR> tags but no set number. For 
example, if a set of 122 matches is created by a XPAT query the output is of the 
form: </P><PRE>&lt;SSize&gt;122&lt;/SSize&gt;</PRE>
<P>In standard mode, information displayed about a set by a <CODE>pr</CODE> 
command is affected if a modifier is attached to the command. The output from a 
<CODE>pr</CODE> command is preceded by the offset in the text of the set member 
being printed. If the set is a region set, the offset is the start of each 
region in the set. In quiet mode, the output contains the numeric offset in a 
tagged format. The settings of <VAR>Raw</VAR>, <VAR>Converted</VAR>, 
<VAR>Label</VAR> and <VAR>Persistent</VAR> affect the information displayed by 
the <CODE>pr</CODE> command. Each of the settings is discussed below. </P>
<P><CODE>{QuietOn}</CODE></P>
<P>With <VAR>Persistent</VAR> turned off, the values of the offsets that are 
output are the logical offsets into the file. The logical and persistent offsets 
are different and non- interchangeable. Persistent offsets are designed for use 
with the update system. (See the documentation for the XPAT update system.) </P>
<P>If the <CODE>pr</CODE> command is not of the form <CODE>pr.region</CODE> , the 
offset of each set member is contained within <VAR>&lt;Start&gt;</VAR> tags and 
the entire output is contained within <VAR>&lt;PSet&gt;</VAR> (for Point Set) 
tags. For example, if the set is of size 2, the output might look as follows 
(without the line breaks). </P><PRE>&lt;PSet&gt;&lt;Start&gt;1234&lt;/Start&gt;
&lt;Start&gt;5554&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;/PSet&gt;</PRE>
<P>If the modifier to the <CODE>pr</CODE> command is <CODE>.region</CODE> , in 
standard mode the text displayed is from the match point to the end of a 
specified region. In quiet mode, the tagged output contains both the offset of 
the match point and the offset of the end of the specified region. The offsets 
of the ends of the region are contained within <VAR>&lt;End&gt;</VAR> tags and 
the entire output is contained within <VAR>&lt;RSet&gt;</VAR> (for Region Set) 
tags. For example, for the above set of size 2, output from a 
<CODE>pr.region</CODE> might look like </P><PRE>
&lt;RSet&gt;&lt;Start&gt;1234&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;End&gt;1444&lt;/End&gt;
&lt;Start&gt;5554&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;End&gt;6000&lt;/End&gt;&lt;/RSet&gt;</PRE>
<P><CODE>{Quiet On</CODE> Label<CODE>}</CODE></P>
<P>When <VAR>Label</VAR> is turned on, the form in which the offset is printed 
changes. The numeric value of the offset into the text within the 
<VAR>&lt;Start&gt;</VAR> or <VAR>&lt;End&gt;</VAR> tags is preceded by an 
identifying label and a colon. This label string is the value of the 
<CODE>Label</CODE> setting. If <CODE>Label</CODE> has not been set, the label 
used in the output is the name of the data dictionary file up to the first 
non-alphanumeric character. For example, if the data dictionary is <CODE>news.dd</CODE> and <CODE>Label</CODE> has not been set, the output 
from a <CODE>pr</CODE> command would look like: </P><PRE>&lt;PSet&gt;&lt;Start&gt;news:1234&lt;/Start&gt;
&lt;Start&gt;news:5554&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;/PSet&gt;</PRE>
<P><CODE>{QuietOn</CODE> Raw <CODE>}</CODE></P>
<P>When <VAR>Raw</VAR> is turned on, in addition to the tagged offsets, the 
output contains text showing the match point and surrounding context. For each 
member of the set, this additional information is output within 
<VAR>&lt;Raw&gt;</VAR> tags following the tagged offset information for each 
member of the set.</P>
<P>The length of the string being output is given within <VAR>&lt;Size&gt;</VAR> 
tags and is followed by the text. As in standard mode, if <CODE>pr</CODE> has no 
modifier, the length of string output is determined by the 
<CODE>PrintLength</CODE> setting and the context shown to the left of the match 
point is determined by the <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> setting. If the modifier is 
a numeric value, this value determines the length of the string and the left 
context is still determined by the <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> setting. If the 
modifier to the <CODE>pr</CODE> command is <CODE>.region</CODE> , the text starts 
at the match point and continues to the end of the specified region. </P>
<P>For example, assuming a <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> setting of 25, and a 
<CODE>LeftContext</CODE> setting of 5, the output from a <CODE>pr</CODE> command 
applied to a set of 2 matches to the string <CODE>sample</CODE> 
would be (without the line breaks shown here): </P><PRE>&lt;PSet&gt;&lt;Start&gt;1234&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;Raw&gt;&lt;Size&gt;25&lt;/Size&gt;
This sample is to be firs&lt;/Raw&gt;

&lt;Raw&gt;&lt;Size&gt;25&lt;/Size&gt;
This sample is to be seco&lt;/Raw&gt;
&lt;/PSet&gt;</PRE>
<P>If the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> , in addition to the above output, the descriptive 
header is output in a tagged format. (See the entry for <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> 
for a description of the header). This information is contained within 
<VAR>&lt;Hdr&gt;</VAR> tags and includes the length of the descriptive string 
within <VAR>&lt;Size&gt;</VAR> tags followed by the string of the header. If the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting was <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> in the 
above example, the output would be (without the line breaks shown here): </P><PRE>&lt;PSet&gt;&lt;Start&gt;1234&lt;/Start&gt;
&lt;Hdr&gt;&lt;Size&gt;10&lt;/Size&gt;First     &lt;/Hdr&gt;
&lt;Raw&gt;&lt;Size&gt;25&lt;/Size&gt;
This sample is to be firs&lt;/Raw&gt;
&lt;Start&gt;3456&lt;/Start&gt;
&lt;Hdr&gt;&lt;Size&gt;10&lt;/Size&gt;Second    &lt;/Hdr&gt;
&lt;Raw&gt;&lt;Size&gt;25&lt;/Size&gt;
This sample is to be seco&lt;/Raw&gt;
&lt;/PSet&gt;</PRE>
<P><CODE>{QuietOn</CODE> Converted<CODE>}</CODE></P>
<P>When <VAR>Converted</VAR> is turned on, in addition to the tagged offsets, 
text following the match point is output for each member of the set. This text 
is displayed with the appropriate character mappings for the XPAT index and any 
stopwords removed. For example, if upper case is mapped to lower case when 
creating the index, the text is displayed in lower case. If the index has the 
word <CODE>to</CODE> as a stopword, <CODE>to 
</CODE> would not appear in the converted text. </P>
<P>For each member of the set, this additional information is output within 
<VAR>&lt;Cvt&gt;</VAR> tags. The length of the output text string is enclosed 
within <VAR>&lt;Size&gt;</VAR> tags and is followed by the text itself. For each 
set member, the text string shown starts at the match point. This is in contrast 
to the <VAR>Raw</VAR> text output which shows the match point with some left 
context. If the <CODE>pr</CODE> has no modifier, the length of the string is 
determined by the <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> setting. If the modifier is numeric, 
this determines the string length. If the modifier is <CODE>.region</CODE> , the 
length of the string is the value of the difference between the offsets of the 
match point and the end of the region. As the displayed text is converted text, 
it is possible that some text conversions cause output, such as multiple blanks 
resulting from character mappings or stopwords, to be suppressed. This may 
result in text that occurs past the end of the region to be displayed. </P>
<P>For example, using the above example of a set of size 2 and further assuming 
that <CODE>to</CODE> and <CODE>be</CODE> are 
stopwords the output might be: </P><PRE>&lt;PSet&gt;&lt;Start&gt;1234&lt;/Start&gt;
&lt;Cvt&gt;&lt;Size&gt;25&lt;/Size&gt;
sample is first used for &lt;/Cvt&gt;
&lt;Start&gt;3456&lt;/Start&gt;
&lt;Cvt&gt;&lt;Size&gt;25&lt;/Size&gt;
sample is second used for&lt;/Cvt&gt;
&lt;/PSet&gt;</PRE>
<P>If the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> , in addition to the above output, the descriptive 
header is given in a tagged format. (See the entry for <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> 
for a description of the header). The information giving the descriptive string 
precedes the <VAR>&lt;Cvt&gt;</VAR> tag and does not have the character mappings 
applied to it. The previous example would change to: </P><PRE>&lt;PSet&gt;&lt;Start&gt;1234&lt;/Start&gt;
&lt;Hdr&gt;&lt;Size&gt;10&lt;/Size&gt;First

this sample is second use&lt;/Cvt&gt;

<P><CODE>{QuietOn</CODE> Persistent<CODE>}</CODE></P>
<P>When <VAR>Persistent</VAR> is turned on, the offsets that are output are the 
persistent (persistent) positions within the text database. As noted earlier, in 
a database that has not been initialized for update, the persistent and logical 
offsets are identical. </P>
<P><CODE>{QuietOn</CODE> Raw Converted Label<CODE>}</CODE></P>
<P>Any combination of the <CODE>QuietOn</CODE> arguments may be used. Thus,

<VAR>string1</VAR> <CODE>..</CODE> <VAR>string2</VAR> 
<P>finds strings that begin with strings occurring within an alphabetic range. 
</P>
<P>The <CODE>range</CODE> operator creates a point set consisting of those 
indexed points in the text that fall alphabetically between <VAR>string1</VAR> 
and <VAR>string2</VAR> inclusive. <VAR>String1</VAR> and <VAR>string2</VAR> are 
patterns that may or may not actually occur in the text being searched. The 
resulting set contains the matches to both <VAR>string1</VAR> and 
<VAR>string2</VAR>. </P>
<P>Both the operands to the <CODE>range</CODE> command must be strings. Using a 
set number with the <CODE>range</CODE> command is illegal and results in a 
syntax error. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "n" <CODE>..</CODE> "z" </PRE>
<P>This query finds all indexed points in the text that occur in the 
  alphabetic ordering between <CODE>n</CODE> and <CODE>z</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "a" <CODE>..</CODE> "z" </PRE>
<P>Again, assuming the text has been indexed on words, this query creates a 
  set of all the words and phrases in alphabetical order (that is, it produces a 
  concordance of the text). </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "1" <CODE>..</CODE> "200" </PRE>
<P>This query find all the strings that fall alphabetically between <CODE>1</CODE> and <CODE>200</CODE> . This gives all the 
  indexed strings that begin with <CODE>1</CODE> or <CODE>200</CODE> . For example, the strings <CODE>1929</CODE> , <CODE>20034</CODE> as well as strings 
  such as <CODE>2003/1</CODE> and <CODE>2000-15000</CODE> are in this range. The resulting set does not 
  contain the strings <CODE>3</CODE> or <CODE>4</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Date including ("1920" <CODE>..</CODE> "1925")
</PRE>
<P>This query finds Date regions that contain dates from 1920 to 1925 
  inclusive. The range <CODE>1920</CODE> <CODE>..</CODE> <CODE>1925</CODE> also contains strings such as "1925000" as they also 
  fall within the range. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "&lt;Date&gt;1920" <CODE>..</CODE> "&lt;Date&gt;1925"
</PRE>
<P>If dates are marked with the tag <CODE>&lt;Date&gt;</CODE>

and <CODE>subset</CODE> in <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , is naturally ordered by rank. That is to say, the 
first member will be that element of <VAR>set1</VAR> that contains the most 
occurrences of members of <VAR>set2</VAR>.</P>
<P>In detail, the <CODE>rankedby</CODE> command operates as follows. It first 
splits all the members of <VAR>set1</VAR> into groups. Each member of a group 
includes the same number of members of <VAR>set2</VAR> as the other members of 
the group. In addition, within a group, the members are sorted into occurence 
order. After it has grouped the members of <VAR>set1</VAR>, the 
<CODE>rankedby</CODE> command sorts the groups into decreasing order of number 
of included members of <VAR>set2</VAR>.</P>
<P>For example, say that <VAR>set1</VAR> has 6 members, as follows: 3 members 
that each contain 2 members of <VAR>set2</VAR>, 2 members that each contain 4 
members of <VAR>set2</VAR>, and 1 member that contains no members of 
<VAR>set2</VAR>. After <CODE>rankedby</CODE> has grouped and sorted 
<VAR>set1</VAR>, the groups are be as follows. The first group consists of the 2 
members of <VAR>set1</VAR> that contain 4 members of <VAR>set2</VAR>. The second 
group consists of the 3 members of <VAR>set1</VAR> that contain 2 members of 
<VAR>set2</VAR>, and the third group consists of the 1 member of <VAR>set1</VAR> 
that contains no members of <VAR>set2</VAR>. Within each group, the members are 
in occurence order. If the user has requested the top 4 sets, the result set 
would contain both members of the first group and the first two members of the 
second group.</P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Story rankedby ("Free trade" near "Canada")</PRE>
<P>This query finds the regions described by <CODE>region 
  Story</CODE> that contain the greatest number of matches to <CODE>Free trade</CODE> when it occurs close to the <CODE>Canada</CODE> . The number of members in the new set is the value 
  of the <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> setting.</P>
  
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Quote rankedby.5 region Author</PRE>
<P>This query creates a set whose members are the 5 members of <CODE>region Quote</CODE> that contain the greatest number of members

<P><CODE>region</CODE> <VAR>string</VAR> </P>
<P><CODE>region</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> .. <VAR>set2</VAR> </P>
<P>produce region sets in a text database. The first two forms of the 
<CODE>region</CODE> command refer to region sets that have been defined 
externally to a XPAT session and for which information is available in the data 
dictionary. These region sets may have been defined using <em>patregion</em> or 
any other program that generates information (in the form that XPAT understands) 
about regions in the text. The third form of the command defines a region set 
during a XPAT session. The results of any of these commands can be used as 
operands to any of the XPAT commands that operate on region sets. </P>
<P><CODE>region</CODE></P>
<P><CODE>Region</CODE> , used with no operand, refers to the particular 
predefined region set that has been designated as the default region. The 
default region is defined by the <CODE>DefaultRegion</CODE> setting and can be 
reset for the remainder of a XPAT session by changing the setting. If no default 
region has been defined, using <CODE>region</CODE> in this form causes an error. 
The following message is generated:</P>
<PRE>No information for default region.</PRE>

<P><CODE>region</CODE> string </P>
<P>The second form of the <CODE>region</CODE> command indicates one of the named 
predefined region sets. The <VAR>string</VAR> is the name that has been given to 
the region set in the data dictionary. For example, the region sets might be the 
chapters of a book, the entries in a dictionary or the headlines in a newspaper 
database. The information about certain regions in the text database is 
generated by a program external to XPAT and is made available during a XPAT 
session via the data dictionary. One program that generates the information is 
<em>patregion</em>. </P>
<P>Note that the string giving the name of the region set can contain blanks or 
special characters, if it is enclosed within <CODE>double quote</CODE> 
marks.</P>
<P><CODE>region</CODE> set1 .. set2 </P>
<P>The third form of the <CODE>region</CODE> command defines a new region set. 
The region set that is created by this command is only available for the 
duration of the XPAT session. Information about this region set can be written to 
a file using the <CODE>export</CODE> command and read into a future XPAT session 
using the <CODE>import</CODE> command. </P>
<P><VAR>Set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> are used to define regions in the new 
set. <VAR>Set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> can be either point sets or region 
sets. If either <VAR>set1</VAR> or <VAR>set2</VAR> is a region set, the 
<CODE>region</CODE> command uses only the first of the pair of pointers 
describing its members in defining the new region. </P>
<P>Each region in the new set is formed as follows. A member of <VAR>set1</VAR> 
is the beginning of a region if it is followed by a member from <VAR>set2</VAR> 
with no other member of <VAR>set1</VAR> occurring between the two members. The 
end point of the new region is defined by the member in <VAR>set2</VAR> that 
most closely follows the <VAR>set1</VAR> member. The region contains the text 
from the beginning of the member of <VAR>set1</VAR> up to but not including the 
member of <VAR>set2</VAR>. This produces the smallest non-overlapping region set 
that can be formed by <VAR>set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR>. The size of the 
region set created is equal to or smaller than the size of <VAR>set1</VAR>. If 
the members of <CODE>set2</CODE> are matches to a pattern, the new region set 
does not contain the occurrences of that pattern. For example, if 
<VAR>set2</VAR> is the set of matches to the string <CODE>End of 
Message</CODE> , the new region set contains no occurrences of the string <CODE>End of Message</CODE> . </P>
<P>If <VAR>set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> are identical, two extra regions may 
be included in the newly created set. These are: a region from the beginning of 
the text to the member of <VAR>set1</VAR> that occurs earliest in the text; and 
a region from the last element of <VAR>set1</VAR> in the text to the end of the 
text. If either of these regions is a substring of length zero, it is not 
included. If the <CODE>shift</CODE> command is applied to <VAR>set1</VAR> or 
<VAR>set2</VAR>, the extra regions are not included in the new set. </P>
<P>Some programs, such as <em>patregion</em>, that produce predefined region 
sets, define the end point of the region in a somewhat different manner. These 
programs deal with patterns of text (rather than points in the text) and the end 
point of the region that is defined is usually the last character in the pattern 
that is used to define the regions. If desired, the <CODE>region</CODE> command 
within a XPAT session can be used in conjunction with the <CODE>shift</CODE> 
command to create a set of regions in which the ends of the regions are at the 
end of a pattern. See the examples below. </P>
<P>XPAT does not support region sets whose members nest or overlap. As described 
above, using <CODE>region</CODE> with operands that are patterns defining nested 
or overlapping regions, creates a region set which is the smallest 
non-overlapping set of regions. <em>Patregion</em> used on the same text creates 
a possibly different region set (also non-overlapping) consisting of regions 
from an opening pattern to the following end pattern. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>region</CODE> including ("Smith" near "Jones")
</PRE>
<P>This query creates a region set, consisting of the members of the default 
  region which contain a match to the string <CODE>Smith</CODE> 
  when it occurs within a prescribed distance of the string <CODE>Jones</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt; "Campbell" within <CODE>region "Speaker Name"</CODE> </PRE>
<P>In this example, we assume that one of the predefined regions has been 
  named <CODE>Speaker Name</CODE> . This query creates a point set 
  that contains matches to the string <CODE>Campbell</CODE> 
  occurring within members of <CODE>region Speaker Name</CODE> . 
  </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  firstb = <CODE>region</CODE> "&lt;A&gt;".."&lt;/B&gt;" 
&gt;&gt;  (<CODE>region B</CODE> within *firstb) including "requested string" </PRE>
<P>The text, in this example, contains regions that begin with <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE> and end with <CODE>&lt;/A&gt;</CODE> . Each of these <CODE>A</CODE> 
  regions contains smaller regions that begin with <CODE>&lt;B&gt;</CODE> and end with <CODE>&lt;/B&gt;</CODE> . Assume, in certain instances, that it is 
  necessary to be able to find the first <CODE>B</CODE> region 
  within each <CODE>A</CODE> region. The use of region in the 
  first query creates a region set named <CODE>firstb</CODE> that 
  can be used to find these regions. The members of <CODE>firstb</CODE> are the pieces of text that begin with the string 
  <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE> and extend to the closest string <CODE>&lt;/B&gt;</CODE> . The second query finds the members of <CODE>region B</CODE> that are within <CODE>firstb</CODE> , and then finds the members of the latter that 
  include <CODE>requested string</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  quote = <CODE>region</CODE> "&lt;Q&gt;" .. (shift.4 "&lt;/Q&gt;") </PRE>
<P>If some components in the text are tagged with <CODE>&lt;Q&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/Q&gt;</CODE> this 
  command creates a region set describing these components. Each region in the 
  set extends from the opening tag <CODE>&lt;Q&gt;</CODE> to the 
  end of the closing tag <CODE>&lt;/Q&gt;</CODE> . By using the 
  shift operator, applied to the <CODE>&lt;/Q&gt;</CODE> , the 
  members of the point set used to find the ends of the new regions all point to 
  the end of the string <CODE>&lt;/Q&gt;</CODE> rather than to the 
  beginning of the tag. </P>

<P>This set of queries is being applied to a database of mail messages. Each 
  message has the string <CODE>From:</CODE> at the beginning. The 
  string <CODE>Received:</CODE> appears at the beginning of the 
  second line of the message indicating the time the message was received. 
  Assume that the first query, identifying the matches to the string <CODE>From:</CODE> , returns a set of size 10. Further assume that 
  there is text in the database preceding the first <CODE>From:</CODE> . The next query creates a region set of size 11 as 
  two additional regions are included in the resulting set: one containing the 
  text from the beginning of the text to the first occurrence of <CODE>From:</CODE> and the other containing the text from the last 
  occurrence of <CODE>From:</CODE> to the end of the text. The 
  third query creates a region set of size 9 as these two regions are not 
  included in the new set. The next query creates a region set describing the 
  sender of the message. The final query finds the matches to <CODE>Bill</CODE> in the regions describing the sender of the message. 
  Notice the use of an asterisk (<CODE>*</CODE> ) before the name of the new 
  region set when it is used as an operand to a XPAT command. </P>

<VAR>set1</VAR>. <VAR>Set1</VAR> may be either a region set or a point set. The 
new set is of the same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P>The size of the set created is determined by the value of the

<VAR>set1</VAR> is less than <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> , then the new set created 
is the same size as <VAR>set1</VAR>. The size can be changed for all subsequent 
uses of <CODE>sample</CODE> during the current session by changing the 
<CODE>SampleSize</CODE> setting. For an individual use of the 
<CODE>sample</CODE> command, the setting can be changed by using a modifier 
attached to the command. The form of the modifier is a period followed by a 
number giving the desired size of the sample set. </P>
<P>The members of the sample set are chosen as follows. If the size of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> is <VAR>x</VAR> and the sample size requested is <VAR>y</VAR>, 
each <VAR>x/y</VAR>th member of <VAR>set1</VAR> is in the sample set. For 
example, if a sample of size 20 is requested from a set of size 2000, the 100th, 
200th members etc. are chosen. The ordering of the set, and hence the members of 
the sample set, is determined when the set is created. The 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting does not determine which members are included in 
the set created by the <CODE>sample</CODE> command as it does for the 
<CODE>subset</CODE> , <CODE>next</CODE> , <CODE>~nextemp</CODE> , and

<H2><A NAME="save"><CODE>save</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>save</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> 
<P>writes the contents of a set to a file. </P>
<P>The <CODE>save</CODE> command is identical to the <CODE>pr</CODE> command 
except that the output is written to a file. The name of the file where the 
information is written is determined by the value of the setting 
<CODE>SaveFile</CODE> . The default value of the setting is <CODE>xpat.res</CODE> . The file used by the <CODE>save</CODE> command can 
be changed at any time during the XPAT session by changing the setting. The 
information output by the <CODE>save</CODE> command is concatenated onto the end 
of the save file if one of the same name already exists. Otherwise, a new file 
is created and the information is written to the new file. Assuming the default 
setting of <CODE>SaveFile</CODE> , the following message is printed on execution 
of the <CODE>save</CODE> command:</P>
<PRE>Saving in xpat.res.</PRE>

<P>For each member in the given set, the output is in the form of an integer 
giving the offset of the set member in the text file followed by a comma, a 
blank, two periods and the characters surrounding the set member. The order in 
which the set is output is determined by the current <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> 
setting. </P>
<P>With no modifier, <CODE>Save</CODE> outputs a line of text for each element 
in <VAR>set1</VAR>. The <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> and <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> 
determine the content of the line saved. With the default settings, the saved 
text is 64 characters in length of which 14 precede the match point. The number 
of characters to the left of the match point can be altered by changing the 
<CODE>LeftContext</CODE> setting. The total number of characters printed can be 
altered by changing the <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> setting. </P>
<P>The total number of characters to be saved can be set for a single instance 
of the command, by using a numeric modifier attached to the <CODE>save</CODE> 
command. The modifier is in the form of a period followed by a number giving the 
total number of characters to be saved. The left context that is saved is still 
determined by the value of the <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> setting. </P>
<P>The second form the modifier can have is a period followed by the string 
<CODE>region</CODE> . When the command <CODE>save.region</CODE> is used, the 
output text starts at the match point and continues to the end of the default 
region in which the match point occurs. If the match point is not within a 
default region, no output is saved for the match point. </P>
<P>The second form of the modifier can be refined to request that the text 
output be in a region other than the default region. An additional modifier, 
specifying a defined set of regions, can be attached to the already modified 
<CODE>save</CODE> command (i.e. to the <CODE>save.region</CODE> ). This 
additional modifier can be in one of three forms: a string giving the name of a 
predefined region, the number of a region set created in the XPAT session, or a 
string preceded by an asterisk (<CODE>*</CODE> ) referring to a named region set 
defined in the XPAT session. As with the form <CODE>save.region</CODE> , described 
above, this use results in the output text starting at the match point with no 
left context and continuing to the end of the region. When the match point is 
not contained in the designated set, no output is saved. </P>
<P>The similarly named commands <CODE>save.commands</CODE> and 
<CODE>save.history</CODE> result in very different behaviour and are described 
in separate entries.</P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "Helen Maday" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save</CODE> </PRE>
<P>As a result of this command, XPAT writes a line of context for each member 
  in the most recently created set. The information is written to the file that 
  is named by the setting <CODE>SaveFile</CODE> . If the setting has not been 
  changed during the session, the file used is <CODE>xpat.res</CODE> . Note that the information is appended to the 
  save file if one of the same name already exists. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save</CODE> "From: Tony Lopez " </PRE>
<P>A line of context for each member of the set that matches the string <CODE>From:</CODE> is written to the save file. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  {PrintLength 120} 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save</CODE> region including "planet" </PRE>
<P>A line of context is written for each member in the set of regions created 
  by the <CODE>including</CODE> query. The line that is written starts at the 
  beginning of each region in of the new set. Since the <CODE>PrintLength</CODE> 
  has been set to 120, each line contains 120 characters and has 14 characters 
  to the left of the beginning of the displayed region. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save.200</CODE> shift.-100 ("procedure" near "policy")
</PRE>
<P>In this case, a line of 200 characters is written to the save file for each 
  member in the set created by the query <CODE>shift.-100 
  ("procedure" near "policy")</CODE> . The text that is written starts 114 
  characters to the left of the string <CODE>procedure</CODE> . 
</P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region including (region EQ including "&lt;A&gt;Doyle&lt;/A&gt;") 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save.region</CODE> </PRE>
<P>The first query finds all the earliest quotes (defined by the <CODE>region EQ</CODE> ) that have <CODE>Doyle</CODE> as 
  the author. The second command saves information about each of the default 
  regions that includes one of these quotes. The information that is written for 
  each of these regions contains the offset in the text file of the region, a 
  comma, a blank followed by two periods and the text of the default region. As 
  no set is given as an operand to the <CODE>save</CODE> command, it is 
  understood that the command applies to the previous set. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Quote including ("stadium" near "Toronto")

&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save.region.Quote</CODE> % </PRE>
<P>The first query finds all quotes that contain the strings <CODE>stadium</CODE> within 80 characters of the string <CODE>Toronto</CODE> . The second command saves information in the save 
  file (<CODE>xpat.res</CODE> unless the <CODE>SaveFile</CODE> 
  setting has been reset) about each of these regions. As in the example above, 
  the output for each set member is in the form of an integer giving the text 
  offset, a comma, a blank followed by two periods and the text beginning at the 
  start of <CODE>region Quote</CODE> and continuing to the end of 
  the region. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save.region.5</CODE> "night" fby "day" </PRE>
<P>This command saves information about the set created by the query <CODE>"night" fby "day"</CODE> . The information written to the save 
  file (after the offset, comma, blank and two periods) starts at the text <CODE>night</CODE> and continues to the end of the region defined by 
  set number 5 that contains the match.</P>

&gt;&gt;  *minutes including "examination schedule" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>save.region.*minutes</CODE> </PRE>
<P>The first query in this example defines a set of regions that are named 
  <CODE>minutes</CODE> . The second query finds the regions in this 
  set that contain the string <CODE>examination schedule</CODE> . 
  The third command saves information about this set in the save file. For each 
  member in this set, the information saved contains the offset, comma, blank 
  and two periods followed by the text of the region in the set named <CODE>minutes</CODE> . </P>

<CODE>{SaveFile</CODE> <VAR>string</VAR><CODE>}</CODE> 
<P>changes the file name used by <CODE>save</CODE> . </P>
<P>The <CODE>SaveFile</CODE> setting determines the file written by the 
<CODE>save</CODE> command. It has a default value of <CODE>xpat.res</CODE> . If the string begins with a numeral, or contains 
blanks or non-alphanumeric characters, it must be enclosed within <CODE>double 
quote</CODE> marks. The file name must also conform to the file naming 
convention of the host operating system. It can be changed at any time during a 
XPAT session and remains in effect until it is changed again or until the end of 
the session. The current value of the <CODE>SaveFile</CODE> setting is displayed 
by the command <CODE>{Settings}</CODE> . </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{SaveFile "output_file"}</CODE> </PRE>
<P>This changes the setting to the value <CODE>output_file</CODE> so that any subsequent use of the 
  <CODE>save</CODE> command writes to this file. The name of the file is not an 
  absolute path name and is therefore located in the current working directory.

<CODE>save.history</CODE> 
<P>writes information to a file about the queries and results in the current XPAT 
session. </P>
<P><CODE>Save.history</CODE> writes a record of a XPAT session. XPAT's history 
list records information about all queries that produce sets. For these queries, 
<CODE>save.history</CODE> saves the set number, the number of members in the 
set, and the query that produced the set in a file. The setting 
<CODE>HistoryFile</CODE> , that determines the file where the information is 
written, has a default value of <CODE>xpat.his</CODE> . A different 
output file can be chosen at any time during a session by changing the setting. 
If a file of this name already exists, the information is concatenated onto the 
end of the file. Otherwise a new file is created. Note that comments are saved 
only if they are on the same line as the command itself. </P>

<H2><A NAME="sets"><CODE>sets</CODE></A></H2>
<P>In the XPAT system, queries are combinations of the XPAT commands 
described in this document. In response to each query, XPAT creates a set which 
is either a point set or a region set. </P>
<P>These sets can be used as operands in subsequent queries. In contrast to the 
conventional approach of a single, nested compound query, XPAT allows complex 
queries to be expressed as a series of simple queries. This provides an 
opportunity to try alternative ways of combining previous result sets to arrive 
at a solution. XPAT provides a history list of all previous sets created in a 
session and a convenient notation to access them. </P>
<P>A member of a point set is a location in the text which is the start of a 
string that continues to the end of the text. The XPAT system finds locations in 
the text where strings, matching pattern(s) given in the query, begin. The 
members of a point set are usually <CODE>index points</CODE> , however, in the 
sets created by <CODE>shift</CODE> or <CODE>offsets</CODE> , (the notation 
<CODE>[n]</CODE> ), the members refer to positions in the text that may or may 
not be index points. </P>
<P>The members of a region set are substrings of the text, beginning and ending 
at specified points. Region sets that are the result of a query within a XPAT 
session are available only for the duration of the session. However, region sets 
can also be defined externally and be made available to the XPAT session. Each 
member of a region set is described by two locations in the database, indicating 
the start and end of the region and these locations may or may not be index 
points. </P>
<P>Region sets may be used in XPAT to restrict searches to desired parts of the 
text. The <CODE>within</CODE> command finds the members of a set that are 
contained in a designated region set. The <CODE>including</CODE> command finds 
the members of the designated region set that contain one or more members of a 
given set. </P>
<P>The sets produced within XPAT can be refined using set arithmetic or proximity 
commands. The difference (<CODE>-</CODE> ) and intersection (<CODE>^</CODE> ) 
commands remove members of an existing set. The proximity (<CODE>fby</CODE> and 
<CODE>near</CODE> ) commands reduce sets by finding the members of a given set 
that have specified text close by. </P>
<P>In addition to refining sets, it is possible to combine two sets to create a 
larger one by using the union (<CODE>+</CODE> ) command. </P>
<P>XPAT queries, applied to a text database, may create large sets; analyzing a 
smaller, representative subset might aid in making decisions about how to 
proceed appropriately with a search. Several commands in XPAT provide this 
capability. <CODE>Sample</CODE> creates a representative subset while 
<CODE>subset</CODE> , <CODE>next</CODE> , and <CODE>first</CODE> each create 
contiguous smaller subsets of a larger set. </P>

<H2><A NAME="shift"><CODE>shift</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>shift</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> 
<P>creates a point set whose members are a specified distance from a set of 
matches. </P>
<P><CODE>Shift</CODE> creates a new set whose members are locations in the text 
which result from an equal shift being applied to all members of 
<VAR>set1</VAR>. <VAR>Set1</VAR> may be either a point set or a region set. If 
it is a region set, the resulting set is a point set containing the first of the 
pair of pointers describing each member of the set. The set created by the 
<CODE>shift</CODE> command is always a point set. </P>
<P>The <CODE>shift</CODE> command creates a new set consisting of pointers that 
are (by default) 10 characters after the original set members. The set created 
is in occurrence order. This default shift distance (10) and direction can be 
changed by using a modifier attached to the <CODE>shift</CODE> command. The 
modifier is of the form of a period followed by a positive or negative integer. 
If the modifier is a negative integer <VAR>n</VAR>, each member of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> is shifted to <VAR>n</VAR> characters before the original 
location. If it is a positive integer <VAR>n</VAR>, the shift is to <VAR>n</VAR> 
characters after that location. </P>
<P>The points in the new set need not be index points. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>shift</CODE> "dog and cat" </PRE>
<P>This creates a new point set whose members are 10 characters after each 
  match to the string <CODE>dog and cat</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "&lt;Tag&gt;" 
&gt;&gt;  pr 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>shift.5</CODE> % 
&gt;&gt;  pr </PRE>
<P>The first query creates a point set of matches to the string <CODE>&lt;Tag&gt;</CODE> . The ordering of this set is alphabetical. 
  The third line of the example creates a second point set whose members start 5 
  characters after a string <CODE>&lt;Tag&gt;</CODE> . The members 
  now point to the start of the contents of the tagged region. This set is in 
  occurrence order. Thus, the order in which the members of the set are 
  displayed by the second <CODE>pr</CODE> is not necessarily the same as that 
  seen with the first <CODE>pr</CODE> command. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>shift.5</CODE> region Tag 
&gt;&gt;  pr </PRE>
<P>Assuming that <CODE>region Tag</CODE> describes a set that 
  begins with a tag <CODE>&lt;Tag&gt;</CODE> , the first query 
  creates a point set whose members now point to the start of the contents of 
  Tag regions. The set created is the same as the one in the above example. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  pr <CODE>shift.-20</CODE> "the best of times" </PRE>
<P>This displays more context before the match points without having to change 
  the <CODE>LeftContext</CODE> setting. The <CODE>pr</CODE> command displays 
  members of a set of matches to the string <CODE>the best of 
  times</CODE> with 34 characters showing before the matches (the default 14 
  characters plus 20 additional resulting from the <CODE>shift</CODE> command). 
  Because of the <CODE>shift</CODE> command, this set is displayed in occurrence 
  order. Note, as with other commands, since the <CODE>pr</CODE> and 
  <CODE>shift</CODE> are on the same line the set is not saved, does not appear 
  on the history list and so is not accessible by a set number.

<H2><A NAME="signif"><CODE>signif</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>signif</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> 
<P>finds frequently occurring words or phrases in the text. </P>
<P><CODE>Signif</CODE> finds the most frequent words or phrases following the 
text matching <VAR>set1</VAR>. <VAR>Set1</VAR> can be either a point set or a 
region set for the first two forms of the command but has a restriction, as 
noted below, for the third form of the command. The set (or sets) created are 
point sets. If <VAR>set1</VAR> is not given, <CODE>signif</CODE> uses the last 
set produced as its operand. </P>
<P>The <CODE>signif</CODE> command looks for words or phrases, in contrast to 
the other XPAT commands that operate on points and regions. For 
<CODE>signif</CODE> , a word is defined as a string of characters ending either 
in a blank or a character that has been mapped to a blank by the character 
mappings used in building the index being used in the current XPAT session. </P>
<P>The <CODE>signif</CODE> command examines the words or phrases that begin with 
a string. The string used is the longest string common to the text pointed to by 
each of the members of <VAR>set1</VAR>. If <VAR>set1</VAR> is a point set 
resulting from a string search, <CODE>signif</CODE> starts with that string. If 
<VAR>set1</VAR> is not given and the previous result was from a 
<CODE>signif</CODE> command, the string is the one associated with the set 
created. (Note that, in addition to the number of matches in the set, 
<CODE>signif</CODE> returns a string value.) If <VAR>set1</VAR> is a region set, 
the first of the pairs of pointers describing the regions are used to find any 
common string beginning in these regions. For example, this might be the pattern 
used to define the regions. If <VAR>set1</VAR> is a point set that is not the 
result of a string search, XPAT checks for a common string beginning the text 
pointed to by each member of <VAR>set1</VAR>. In some cases, this common string 
is the null (empty) string. </P>
<P><CODE>Signif</CODE> has three different modes of operation. A modifier can be 
attached to the <CODE>signif</CODE> command. The syntax of the modifier is a 
period followed by an integer <VAR>n</VAR>. </P>
<P>The first mode of the command, <CODE>signif</CODE> with no modifier, finds a 
frequent word or phrase and then, by reapplying <CODE>signif</CODE> to the 
resulting set, may be used to extend this phrase. In this mode, the command 
finds the string and then finds all possible extensions, in the text, of this 
string up to the next blank. <CODE>Signif</CODE> creates the set, among the 
matches to these possible extensions, with the most members. </P>
<P>The second mode of the command, <CODE>signif</CODE> with a positive integer 
<VAR>n</VAR> as modifier, finds the most commonly occurring phrase of length 
<VAR>n</VAR> words beginning with the string. The set created contains those 
members of <VAR>set1</VAR> that are the matches to the most frequent phrase 
beginning with the given string that is at least <VAR>n</VAR> words in length. 
</P>
<P>The third mode of the command, <CODE>signif</CODE> with a negative integer 
<VAR>n</VAR> as modifier, creates <VAR>n</VAR> sets which are the matches to the 
<VAR>n</VAR> most frequent phrases beginning with the string. This use of the 
<CODE>signif</CODE> command is restricted to sets matching a string or a set 
created by a <CODE>range</CODE> command. Using any other set as an operand is 
illegal and results in the error message:</P>
<PRE>Repetitive signif should be on strings or ranges only</PRE>

<P>Note that the set created by <CODE>signif</CODE> is identical to that created 
by <CODE>signif.-1</CODE> but not necessarily to the one created by 
<CODE>signif.1</CODE> .(See the examples.) </P>
<P>The displayed output from the <CODE>signif</CODE> command gives the number of 
matches and the word or phrase found (preceded by <VAR>text=</VAR>). The text is 
shown with the character mappings applied and stop words removed (see data 
dictionary documentation). For example, this means, if <CODE>&gt;</CODE> has been mapped to a blank and the word <CODE>the</CODE> is not a stopword, one would see the following: </P><PRE>  &gt;&gt; <CODE>signif</CODE>  "&lt;HL&gt;"

&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.3</CODE> " 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.-10</CODE> " </PRE>
<P>The above queries, except the second one, operate on the entire text. In 
  these cases, the string that the <CODE>signif</CODE> command starts with is 
  the empty string. The first query finds the most frequent word or phrase that 
  occurs in the text. The second query operates on the set created by the first 
  query and extends this result by one word. The third query finds the most 
  frequent phrase of at least three words that occurs in the text. The fourth 
  query finds the ten most frequent words or phrases within the text. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif</CODE> "y" </PRE>
<P>This finds the most frequent word that starts with the letter <CODE>y</CODE> in the text database. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif</CODE> "to be" </PRE>
<P>Note that the string <CODE>to be</CODE> used by the 
  <CODE>signif</CODE> command does not end in a blank. Since <CODE>signif</CODE> 
  looks at all extensions of the string up to the next blank, the only phrases 
  eligible to be the most frequent phrase starting with this string are two-word 
  phrases. In many texts, the most likely set created with this command would be 
  the point set matching the two-word phrase <CODE>to be 
 </CODE> (ending in a blank). </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif</CODE> "to be " </PRE>
<P>In this example, the string given ends in a blank so the possible 
  extensions of this string that are examined by <CODE>signif</CODE> are all 
  three-word phrases. The point set created as the answer to this command is the 
  set of matches to the three-word phrase starting with the two words <CODE>to be</CODE> that occurs most frequently in the text. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.1</CODE> "to be" </PRE>
<P>This command creates a set of the most frequent phrase whose word length is 
  one. The newly created set is the set of matches to the word <CODE>to</CODE> that are contained in the set of matches to the phrase 
  <CODE>to be</CODE> . This means that the size of the set is 
  probably smaller than the set of matches to <CODE>to</CODE> but 
  that the text shown is the string <CODE>to</CODE> . Also note 
  that this set is not equal to the set created in the preceding example or to 
  the set created in the following example. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.-1</CODE> "to be" </PRE>
<P>This command finds the most frequent phrase that begins with the string 
  <CODE>to be</CODE> . The answer to this is a two-word phrase that 
  is identical to that found in the second example. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.-3</CODE> "to be" </PRE>
<P>This command finds three sets that are the matches to the three most 
  frequent phrases beginning with the string <CODE>to be</CODE> . 
  The first set is the same set created in the example before last. The next set 
  is created by applying <CODE>signif</CODE> to two sets and comparing the 
  resulting sets. <CODE>Signif</CODE> is first applied to a set that is created 
  by taking the difference between the set represented by the original string 
  and the new set just created. <CODE>Signif</CODE> is also applied to the set 
  just created. The larger set from these two <CODE>signif</CODE> applications 
  is the second answer. This same procedure is repeated on the original set and 
  on the two new sets to obtain the third set. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.4</CODE> "to be" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif</CODE> </PRE>
<P>The first command creates the set of matches to the most frequent four-word 
  phrase that begins with <CODE>to be</CODE> . The second 
  <CODE>signif</CODE> is applied to the resulting four-word phrase. Since this 
  result ends in a blank, the second <CODE>Signif</CODE> searches for the most 
  frequently occurring five-word phrase that begins with the four words located 
  by the first command. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "aba" .. "abz" 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif</CODE> </PRE>
<P>The first command creates a point set that matches all strings that are 
  alphabetically between <CODE>aba</CODE> and <CODE>abz</CODE> . <CODE>Signif</CODE> applied to this set creates a 
  set of matches to the most frequent word in the text that begins with <CODE>ab</CODE> . </P>

&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.-4</CODE> *auth </PRE>
<P>The first command creates a region set. The second command creates a set 
  representing the most frequent string at the beginning of these regions. 
  Assuming that in the character mappings the <CODE>&gt;</CODE> is 
  mapped to a blank, the string that <CODE>signif</CODE> uses to find the 
  extension consists at least of the word <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE> . 
  Thus, the set created is the set of matches to the string <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE> followed by at least one other word. The third 
  command gives the most common two word phrase starting the region set named 
  <CODE>auth</CODE> . The first word of this phrase will be <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE> . The last command is illegal and results in the 
  following error message: </P>
<PRE>Repetitive signif should be on strings or ranges only</PRE>
  
  
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>signif.-4</CODE> "&lt;A&gt;" </PRE>
<P>This command creates four sets. These are the sets of matches to the four 
  most frequent phrases starting with the string <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE> . Notice that, if the <CODE>&gt;</CODE> has been mapped to a blank, the phrases are at least 
  two words in length. </P>

<H2><A NAME="{SortOrder}"><CODE>{SortOrder}</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>{SortOrder</CODE> <VAR>number</VAR><CODE>}</CODE> 
<P>determines the ordering of a set. </P>
<P>The behaviour of <CODE>first</CODE> , <CODE>next</CODE> , <CODE>pr</CODE> , 
<CODE>save</CODE> , <CODE>subset</CODE> and <CODE>~nextemp</CODE> are affected by 
the ordering associated with their operands. The <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting 
indicates whether these sets are to be treated in alphabetical order or in the 
order that members of the set occur in the text (occurrence order). (A 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting of <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> 
(explanation below) also determines what is displayed by the <CODE>pr</CODE> and 
<CODE>save</CODE> commands.) </P>
<P>Every set in XPAT has an internal ordering which varies from set to set, as 
described below. The ordering is chosen by XPAT, for reasons of efficiency, and 
no assumptions can be made in this regard. It is often desirable, however, to 
present results in a certain order, and the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting 
exists to control this. When a set is an operand of a <CODE>pr</CODE> or 
<CODE>save</CODE> command or a new set is created by a <CODE>first</CODE> , 
<CODE>next</CODE> , <CODE>subset</CODE> or <CODE>~nextemp</CODE> command, the 
ordering of the set and hence the behaviour of the command is determined by the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting. This may mean that the existing set must be 
reordered for processing with these commands. For some XPAT commands this results 
in a change in the internal ordering, and this change is reflected when 
subsequently operating with a <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting of <CODE>AsIs</CODE> (explanation below). The ordering of a set that is not 
an operand to one of the above commands is not affected when the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting changes. </P>
<P>The permissible values for the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting are <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , <CODE>Alpha</CODE> , <CODE>Occur</CODE> and <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> . The default 
value of <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> is <CODE>AsIs</CODE> . If the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , the set is 
processed in the order in which it currently exists. If the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>Alpha</CODE> , the set is 
processed in alphabetical order. If the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>Occur</CODE> or <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> , the set is 
processed in occurrence order. For sets whose internal ordering is not 
alphabetical, for example region sets, displaying results with a 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting of <CODE>Alpha</CODE> will require 
resorting which may result in additional computation delay depending on the set 
size. </P>
<P>Setting the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting to <CODE>Occur</CODE> results in further changes to the behaviour of the 
<CODE>pr</CODE> and <CODE>save</CODE> commands. For <CODE>Pr</CODE> and 
<CODE>save</CODE> , with a <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting of <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , <CODE>Alpha</CODE> or <CODE>Occur</CODE> , the position offset for each set member is 
displayed. With a <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting of <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> , the contents of a named region set are output in 
place of the position offset. Setting <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> to <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> requires reference to two regions within the 
brace brackets used to change the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting. The first 
region referenced is the one whose contents are displayed in place of an offset 
when members of a set are displayed. The second region referenced must be one 
that contains both the match points of the members of a set and the first region 
referenced in the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting (<CODE>OccurHead</CODE> ). </P>
<P>The text displayed in place of the offset, as a result of 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> being set to <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> , is the 
<em>first</em> region found of the specified type within the containing region 
(also specified in the <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> setting). If the 
text to be displayed begins with an opening angle bracket, the text until the 
closing angle bracket is ignored and the next character is displayed. If the 
next character is another angle bracket, the preceding process is repeated 
iteratively. A maximum of 10 characters or up to the next <CODE>&lt;</CODE> in the text is displayed. Both these region sets, 
named in the <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> setting, must be in the data 
dictionary. If they are not, for example if <CODE>X</CODE> is 
named in the setting but does not exist in the data dictionary, the following 
error message results:</P>
<PRE>No information for region X in the data dictionary</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting can be changed at any time during a XPAT 
session and remains in effect until it is changed again or until the end of the 
session. The current value of the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is displayed by 
the command <CODE>{Settings}</CODE> . </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{SortOrder Alpha}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  pr % </PRE>
<P>The first command sets the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting so that the 
  displayed set, following the <CODE>pr</CODE> command, is in alphabetical 
  order. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{SortOrder Occur}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  sample "Moriarity" 
&gt;&gt;  pr % 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{SortOrder AsIs}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  pr % </PRE>
<P>The sample set created in the first example has an alphabetical ordering. 
  With the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting of <CODE>Occur</CODE> , 
  the first <CODE>pr</CODE> displays the set in occurrence order. However, after 
  the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> is reset to <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , the 
  set that is printed after the next <CODE>pr</CODE> is displayed in alphabetic 
  order. Note that the sample set is not affected by the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> 
  setting at the time of its creation and that the reordering for printing is 
  temporary. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{SortOrder OccurHead LF E}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  pr "shaks" </PRE>
<P>One effect of setting the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> to <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> is that the set is displayed in occurrence 
  order by the <CODE>pr</CODE> command. The beginning of each line, following 
  the <CODE>pr</CODE> command, contains the starting characters of the first 
  region, named <CODE>LF</CODE> , that occurs with the region named 
  <CODE>E</CODE> containing a member of the point set matching the 
  string <CODE>shaks</CODE> . </P>

&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{SortOrder Occur}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  pr subset % 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>{SortOrder AsIs}</CODE> 
&gt;&gt;  pr % </PRE>
<P>The subset displayed by the first <CODE>pr</CODE> command is shown in 
  alphabetical order. With the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> set to <CODE>Occur</CODE> , the next <CODE>pr</CODE> command displays the 
  subset in occurrence order. With the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> set to <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , the final <CODE>pr</CODE> displays the set of 
  matches to the string <CODE>Ondaatje</CODE> in occurrence order 
  since this point set was reordered permanently as a result of the subset 
  command executed when the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> was <CODE>Occur</CODE> . </P>

<H2><A NAME="stop"><CODE>stop</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>stop</CODE> 
<P>terminates a XPAT session. The use of this command causes the session to end 
and the XPAT process to exit. A message may be generated telling how much 
computer time has been used during the XPAT session. </P>

<H2><A NAME="string search"><CODE>string search</CODE></A></H2>

<P>A command consisting only of a string causes XPAT to search for occurrences of 
the string in the text database. A set is created whose members are matches to 
all index points in the text that begin with the given string. A match occurs 
when the given string (after having the character mappings applied to it and 
stopwords removed) is the same as the text that begins at an index point (also 
having had the character mappings applied and stopwords removed). Searching for 
phrases with a XPAT index is as fast as searching for a word or a prefix of a 
word. After a search, the number of matches to the pattern is displayed, but the 
results of the search are not shown unless requested by a <CODE>pr</CODE> 
command.</P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  in </PRE>
<P>If the index currently being used is based on words, the matches returned 
  from this input string are the matches to all the phrases in the text that 
  begin with the two characters <CODE>in</CODE> . That is, there 
  will be matches to strings beginning with the word <CODE>in 
 </CODE> as well as to strings beginning with <CODE>inside</CODE> , 
  <CODE>into</CODE> etc. In order to match only strings beginning 
  with the word <CODE>in</CODE> a blank must be added to the 
  search string and the string enclosed within quotation marks. </P>
<P>If each character is indexed, the matches returned would also include 
  strings that appear as part of words such as <CODE>within</CODE> 
  and <CODE>getting</CODE> . </P>
<P>If the index has been made with character mappings that map upper case to 
  lower case, the matches would also include matches to strings that include 
  <CODE>In</CODE> . </P>
  
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  "to be or not to be that is the question" </PRE>
<P>If the index used when searching for the above string was created with the 
  stopwords <CODE>to</CODE> , <CODE>be</CODE> , <CODE>or</CODE> , <CODE>not</CODE> , <CODE>that</CODE> , <CODE>is</CODE> and <CODE>the</CODE> , this string search is equivalent to a search on the 
  string <CODE>question</CODE> . </P>

<H2><A NAME="subset"><CODE>subset</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>subset</CODE> <VAR>set1</VAR> 
<P>finds a number of contiguous members of a set. </P>
<P><CODE>Subset</CODE> creates a set of a specified size containing members 
starting at a designated location in <VAR>set1</VAR>. The members of the new set 
are in the order they appear in <VAR>set1</VAR>. <VAR>Set1</VAR> may be a region 
set or a point set. The new set is of the same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P>The operation of the <CODE>subset</CODE> command is affected by the size of 
the set requested and the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting. </P>
<P>The ordering of a set, and hence which members are chosen to be in the set 
created by the <CODE>subset</CODE> command, is controlled by the 
<CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting. If the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting is <CODE>Alpha</CODE> , the set is ordered alphabetically; if it is <CODE>Occur</CODE> or <CODE>OccurHead</CODE> , the set is 
ordered as the members occur in the text; and if the <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> 
setting is <CODE>AsIs</CODE> , the set order is the current one and 
may thus be either alphabetic or occurrence order. The location within 
<VAR>set1</VAR> to start selecting members for the new set is indicated by a 
numeric location in the ordered set. This numeric location is given to the 
<CODE>subset</CODE> command as a modifier attached to the command. The modifier 
is in the form of a period followed by an integer that can be either positive or 
negative. A positive integer gives the desired location relative to the 
beginning of the set and a negative integer gives it relative to the end of the 
set. Without any modifier the <CODE>subset</CODE> is taken from the start of 
<VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P>The size of the set created is determined by the value of the setting 
<CODE>SampleSize</CODE> which has a default value of 10. If the size of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> is less than <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> , then the new set created 
is the same size as <VAR>set1</VAR>. Changing the <CODE>SampleSize</CODE> 
setting affects all subsequent uses of <CODE>subset</CODE> during the current 
session. The size of the <CODE>subset</CODE> can be specified for an individual 
use of the command by using a second modifier attached to the already modified 
<CODE>subset</CODE> command. This modifier is also of the form of a period 
followed by a numeric value giving the desired set size. </P>
<P>The <CODE>subset</CODE> command can be used by itself or with the 
<CODE>pr</CODE> , <CODE>save</CODE> or <CODE>export</CODE> commands. The 
<CODE>subset</CODE> may only be used in conjunction with these commands. 
</P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  {SampleSize 40} 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>subset</CODE> % </PRE>
<P>The first command changes the SampleSize setting and the query in the 
  second line returns a set that contains the first 40 members of the most 
  recent result in the session. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>subset</CODE> .10 "Montreal " </PRE>
<P>This query creates a set of 40 members (assuming the SampleSize setting in 
  the first example) starting at the tenth member in the set of matches to the 
  string <CODE>Montreal</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>subset</CODE> .-10 "Montreal " </PRE>
<P>This is similar to the previous query but the new set starts at the tenth 
  member from the end of the set. Therefore, the resulting set size is only 10 
  even though the SampleSize setting is 40. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>subset</CODE> .5.30 % </PRE>
<P>This query creates a set of 30 members starting from the fifth member of 
  the most recent result in the session. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  {SortOrder Occur} 
&gt;&gt;  <CODE>subset</CODE> .-20.20 5 </PRE>
<P>The query in the second line of the example creates a set containing the 
  final 20 members in the set represented by set number 5. The 
  <CODE>SortOrder</CODE> setting means that both set number 5 and the new set 
  are in occurrence order. </P>

<H2><A NAME="~sync"><CODE>~sync</CODE></A></H2>
<CODE>~sync</CODE> <VAR>string</VAR> 
<P>outputs a tagged identifier. </P>
<P>The command <CODE>~sync</CODE> is available only when the XPAT session is 
operating in quiet mode. <CODE>~sync</CODE> outputs a message tagged with 
<VAR>Sync</VAR> tags containing the given string. This command is mainly used 
when XPAT is integrated into a more complex system. The output from the 
<CODE>~sync</CODE> command can then be used to identify a position in an input 
stream when information is being received from several different sources. 
</P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  <CODE>~sync</CODE> "festival" </PRE>
<P>The output from this command is the tagged string: <CODE>&lt;Sync&gt;festival&lt;/Sync&gt;</CODE> . </P>

<H2><A NAME="thesaurus"><CODE>thesaurus</CODE></A></H2>
<P>provides an efficient way to describe patterns that have some 
common quality. 
For example, if many searches of a database involve finding references in the 
text to money in different currencies, the thesaurus provides the capability to 
define a variable describing all the possible patterns to be used in these 
searches. </P>
<P>The <CODE>thesaurus</CODE> variable is defined in a file named in the data 
dictionary. Within the thesaurus file, each separate variable, called a 
<em>word</em>, is surrounded by <VAR>&lt;Entry&gt;</VAR> tags. Within the 
<VAR>&lt;Entry&gt;</VAR> tags are other tagged areas: the name of the variable 
is contained within <VAR>&lt;Word&gt;</VAR> tags, followed by the associated 
query contained within <VAR>&lt;Query&gt;</VAR> tags. The thesaurus capability 
is implemented using <CODE>macros</CODE> so the query may be a complex one 
creating more than one set. The same cautions, described for macros, apply to 
bracketing and syntax errors. </P>
<P>To invoke a thesaurus variable the name is preceded by the character 
<VAR>&lt;</VAR>. For example, a thesaurus variable named <CODE>money</CODE> may be used within a XPAT session as follows: 
</P><CODE>&lt;"money"</CODE> 
<P>As with macros, thesaurus invocations are replaced by an exact copy of the 
definition. This means that a thesaurus variable can be used as an operand in 
other XPAT queries. Note, however, that it may be necessary to bracket the entire 
invocation in order to ensure correct results from the query. In practice, 
bracketing the definition itself is a good general method. </P>
<P>If an undefined thesaurus variable is used, for example &lt;<CODE>testing</CODE> , the following error message is generated.</P>
<PRE>The macro testing is undefined</PRE>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  (<CODE>&lt;"policy"</CODE> ) near (<CODE>&lt;"economy"</CODE> ) </PRE>
<P>Assume that the following tagged data appears in the thesaurus file 
  reference in the data dictionary for the XPAT session.</P>
<PRE>&lt;Entry&gt;
 &lt;Word&gt;economy&lt;/Word&gt;
 &lt;Query&gt;("economic " + "fiscal " + "monetary " + "economy")&lt;/Query&gt;
&lt;/Entry&gt;
&lt;Entry&gt;
 &lt;Word&gt;policy&lt;/Word&gt;
 &lt;Query&gt;("policy " + "policies ")&lt;/Query&gt;
&lt;/Entry&gt;</PRE> 
<P>The query shown finds any matches to either of the strings
described by the thesaurus variable <CODE>policy</CODE> that
occur near any of the strings that are part of the union described
by the thesaurus variable <CODE>economy</CODE> .
</P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  *speaker including <CODE>&lt;"macbeth"</CODE> </PRE>
<P>This assumes that the following tagged data appears in
the thesaurus file.</P>
<PRE>&lt;Entry&gt;
 &lt;Word&gt;macbeth&lt;/Word&gt;
 &lt;Query&gt;"macbeth" - (shift.5 "lady
macbeth")&lt;/Query&gt;
&lt;/Entry&gt;</PRE>
<P>The query shown finds those members of
the region set defined by the name <CODE>speaker</CODE> that
contain <CODE>Macbeth</CODE> but not <CODE>Lady
Macbeth</CODE> . </P>

<H2><A NAME="union"><CODE>union</CODE></A></H2>
<VAR>set1</VAR> <CODE>+</CODE> <VAR>set2</VAR> 
<P>combines two sets. </P>
<P>The <CODE>union</CODE> operator (<CODE>+</CODE> ) creates a new set containing 
the members of both <VAR>set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR>, with duplicates 
removed. <VAR>Set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> can be either point sets or region 
sets. If either of <VAR>set1</VAR> or <VAR>set2</VAR> is a point set the new set 
is also a point set. </P>
<P>If both <VAR>set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> are region sets and there is no 
overlap or nesting of any member from <VAR>set1</VAR> and any member from 
<VAR>set2</VAR>, the union set is a region set. If overlap or nesting occurs, 
<VAR>set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> are treated as point sets by using the first 
of each pair of pointers describing the regions in the sets. The new set created 
is the union of these point sets. The following message is generated when this 
occurs:</P>
<PRE>Warning: Addition of Region objects produced a region
with overlaps -- simplified into a point set</PRE>

<P>Note that if both <VAR>set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> are region sets and a 
member of <VAR>set1</VAR> coincides <em>exactly</em> with a member of 
<VAR>set2</VAR>, this is not considered to be an instance of overlap or nesting; 
rather, these members are considered identical and only one will be a member of 
the output set. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  USA + "U.S.A" + "United States" + "America "
</PRE>
<P>This query creates a new point set containing all matches to each of the 
  individual sets in the query. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  region Title + region Summary </PRE>
<P>Assuming that the members of region Title and of region Summary do not 
  overlap or nest, this query creates a new region set containing all the 
  members of both regions. </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt;  *your_region + region First </PRE>
<P>Assuming that <CODE>your_region</CODE> was created during the 
  current XPAT session and contains a member that overlaps one or more members of 
  <CODE>region First</CODE> , this query creates a point set. The 
  members in the new set consist of the first of the two pointers that describe 
  the members of <CODE>your_region</CODE> and of <CODE>region First</CODE> . XPAT prints a warning message before 
  printing the number of matches in the new set. </P>

<H2><A NAME="within"><CODE>within</CODE></A></H2>
<VAR>set1</VAR> <CODE>within</CODE> <VAR>set2</VAR> 
<P>finds members of a set within a given region. </P>
<P><CODE>Within</CODE> creates a set containing those members of <VAR>set1</VAR> 
that are located in one of the regions of the text described by <VAR>set2</VAR>. 
<VAR>Set1</VAR> may be either a point set or a region set. <VAR>Set2</VAR> must 
be a region set. The new set is of the same type as <VAR>set1</VAR>. </P>
<P><VAR>Set2</VAR> may be a predefined region set, a region set that has been 
created within the XPAT session using the <CODE>region</CODE> command, a region 
set resulting from the use of the <CODE>import</CODE> command, or the result of 
a previous query in the session. </P>
<P>If <VAR>set1</VAR> is a point set, each member is examined to see if it falls 
within a region from <VAR>set2</VAR> in order to determine inclusion in the new 
set. If <VAR>set1</VAR> is a region set, the first of the pair of pointers 
(offsets into the text) describing each member is examined to see if it falls 
within a region of <VAR>set2</VAR>. The second pointer of the pair does not have 
to fall within a region of <VAR>set2</VAR> for the region to be included in the 
new set. That is to say, if <VAR>set1</VAR> and <VAR>set2</VAR> are both region 
sets and they overlap, members of <VAR>set1</VAR> are included in the result of 
<CODE>within</CODE> if they <em>begin</em> within a member of <VAR>set2</VAR>. 
</P>
<P>The command <CODE>not within</CODE> creates a set containing those members of 
<VAR>set1</VAR> that are not in any of the regions described by <VAR>set2</VAR>. 
</P><PRE> set1 <CODE>not within</CODE> set2 </PRE>
<P>is the same as </P><PRE> set1 - (set1 <CODE>within</CODE> set2) </PRE>
<P><CODE>Including</CODE> and <CODE>within</CODE> are similar in that they both 
restrict searches to specified regions in the text. They differ in the set that 
is created. The <CODE>including</CODE> command creates a set of regions that 
<em>contain</em> one or more members of another set, while <CODE>within</CODE> 
creates a set of pointers or regions that are <em>contained in</em> members of a 
region set. </P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>
<PRE>&gt;&gt; "Cohen" <CODE>within</CODE> region Speaker </PRE>
<P>In this example, the predefined <CODE>region Speaker</CODE> 
  defines regions of the text that contain speakers' names. This query creates a 
  set of matches to <CODE>Cohen</CODE> that falls within the 
  regions described by <CODE>region Speaker</CODE> . </P>
<PRE>&gt;&gt; "Fontaine" <CODE>not within</CODE> region Speaker </PRE>
<P>This query finds all references to <CODE>Fontaine</CODE> that

&gt;&gt;  ("Spanish" <CODE>within</CODE> region Language) <CODE>within</CODE> *first </PRE>
<P>The first query defines regions of the text that start at the string <CODE>&lt;Etym&gt;</CODE> and end with the string <CODE>&lt;/Language&gt;</CODE> . The second query finds all the matches
