    <h1 class="pageTitle">Browsing - Overview and Contents</h1>
    <p> Through a combination of <a href="colldatabases.html">database</a> tables
      and <a href="collmgr.html">collmgr</a> field configuration,
      dynamic browsing is available through the DLXS middleware. When the proper
      CGI-based URL is received, the middleware checks for certain metadata in the
      database tables, packages some of it in XML, uses some of it, as is in its
      stored format of XML, and lets XSLT format the results. At run time, no <a href="../xpat/index.html">XPAT</a>   queries are needed, only MySQL queries are run against the item browse tables
      in the  <a href="colldatabases.html">dlxs
        database</a>. </p>
    <p>After the tables are prepared, that is,  populated with item metadata through
      the <span class="command">$DLXSROOT/bin/browse/updatebrowsedb.pl</span> script (aka &quot;database populator&quot;),
      configuration for the behavior of dynamic browsing is accomplished by modifying
      certain <a href="collmgr.html">collmgr</a>   fields.</p>
    <p>Provisions will soon be made for creating static HTML browse pages with the
      database populator script. </p>

    <h1> <a name="ItemBrowseTables" id="ItemBrowseTables"/>Item browse database tables </h1>
    <p>There are three tables in the dlxs database that are specifically used for
      dynamic browsing in the middleware:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="command">ItemColl</li>
      <li class="command">ItemBrowse</li>
      <li class="command">ItemBrowseCounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ItemColl table holds, for each item/document and collection combination,
      one row containing the following columns: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the idno</li>
      <li>the collection id</li>
      <li>the modification date of the row's information</li>
      <li>XML metadata
        about the item: in the case of TextClass, this is simply the <span class="command">DLXSTEXTCLASS/HEADER</span>      element that is retrieved from an XPAT query in the &quot;database
        populator&quot; script. In the case of ImageClass, the Perl subclass used
        by the database populator grabs information from the MySQL or XPAT data
        and wraps it in specific XML before filling in this field. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ItemBrowse table holds, for each item/document's browseable field (e.g.,
      author, title, etc.): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the idno</li>
      <li>the collection id</li>
      <li>the field name</li>
      <li>the value of the field </li>
      <li>rank (not currently used) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ItemBrowseCounts table holds, for each collection, a list of rows containing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the colleciton id</li>
      <li>the field name </li>
      <li>the first character or the first two characters of the sortable
        field's value (sortable title, author's name) </li>
      <li>the count of items that begin with that first character or those first
        two characters </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="CollmgrFields" id="CollmgrFields"/>Collmgr fields for configuration </h2>
    <p>The main fields in the collmgr that need to be set properly are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>locale</li>
      <li>browsenav</li>
      <li>browsefields</li>
      <li>browseupdatemodule</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See <a href="#Configure">Configure the collmgr fields</a> below for
      more information.</p>
    <h1><a name="Preparation"></a>Preparing collections for browsing </h1>
    <h2><a name="Configure" id="Configure"/>Configure
        the collmgr fields </h2>
    <p>Start collmgr and change the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="command">devhost</span>: if you are running the database populator in a development environment
        (that is, where <span class="command"><a href="../program/devenvironment.html#workdirs">DLPS_DEV</a></span> environment variable
        is set), you can have the middleware use  XPAT-indexed data that is
        on a  machine different from the usual host. This can be useful for testing
        purposes. </li>
      <li><span class="command">locale</span>: (this should be changed to a UTF-8 type of encoding, e.g., <span class="command">en_US.UTF-8</span>)</li>


      <li><span class="command">browseable</span> A &quot;yes&quot; (case-insensitive) value in this field enables the browse tab in the user interface.  If a file in the collection-specific web directory for this collection contains a file named <code>browse.html</code> that page will be served but only if <span class="command">browsefields</span> is <i>empty</i>. Fallback is applied to select the correct <code>browse.html</code> file for collection-specific customization.  This supports static browse pages.  If <code>browse.html</code> is not present a dynamic browse page will be served based on data from the browse database.  When a dynamic browse page is served the <span class="command">browsenav</span> field value is consulted and must be defined. </li>


      <li><span class="command">browsenav</span>: enter 0, 1, or 2. If you want no paging, that is, that all
        items in the colleciton appear on one HTML page for the user to browse,
        enter 0. Enter 1, if you want &quot;one level of browsing&quot;, that is, that a
        separate page be created for each first character of the value in question
        (e.g., title or author) and that a navigation bar be built that allows
        the user to navigate to each page, for example, jump to the page listing
        items whose value begins with &quot;M&quot;. Entering 2 in this field will create
        a &quot;two-level browse&quot;, where two navigation bars will be created. The first
        bar will allow the user to jump to items whose values begin with a particular
        first character (e.g., jump to the records that begin with &quot;B&quot;). The second
        navigation bar will allow the user to jump to items whose values begin
        with a particular two-character combination, (e.g., records that begin
        with &quot;Bu&quot;). This decision is left to the collection coordinator. We have
        found that the level is based on how many total items there are in
        the collection and therefore what is a reasonable number of browseable
        items for a single HTML page. </li>
      <li> <span class="command">browsefields</span>: list the browseable fields for the collection. For example,
        some collections may have only title browsing, others may need both title
        and author, etc.  <i>Leave this field empty to enable static browsing.</i> </li>
      
      <li>
        <p><span class="command">browseupdatemodule</span>: specifies
          the name of the browse update Perl module that will be used by
          the updatebrowsedb.pl script to populate the database. This
          value is analogous to the <tt>appmodule</tt> and
          <tt>subclassmodule</tt> fields.  (This field exists as of Release 12a;
          it supersedes a Perl configuration hash used in Release 12.)</p>
        
        <p>The module files are located in
        <tt>DLXSROOT/bin/browse</tt>.  If a dynamic browse page is to
        be served this field must have a value.  Specialized behavior
        can be obtained by subclassing the browse update modules.
        The currently available browse update module values are as follows:
         <dl>
            <dt>ImageClass</dt><dd><tt>BrowseUpdate/ImageMysqlBU</tt></dd>
            <dt>FindaidClass</dt><dd><tt>BrowseUpdate/FindaidBU</tt></dd>
            <dt>TextClass</dt>
            <dd>
              <dl><dt>encodingtype = <tt>monograph</tt></dt>
                <dd><tt>BrowseUpdate/MonographBU</tt></dd>
              </dl>
              <dl><dt>encodingtype = <tt>serialissue</tt></dt>
                <dd><tt>BrowseUpdate/SerialIssueBU</tt> <br />Note that newspapers are serialissue encodingtype.</dd>
              </dl>
              <dl><dt>encodingtype = <tt>serialarticle</tt></dt>
                <dd><tt>BrowseUpdate/SerialArticleBU</tt></dd>
              </dl>
            </dd>
         </dl>
        </p>
      </li>
      
    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="PopulatingTables" id="PopulatingTables"/>Populating the item browse
        tables </h2>
    <p>To initially populate or to update the item browse tables, there is a
       script called
       <span class="command">updatebrowsedb.pl</span> which is located in <span class="command">$DLXSROOT/bin/browse</span>.
       Running this program will populate or update the rows necessary in each
       of the three ItemBrowse related tables. These tables will be queried when
       the user requests browsing from the middleware.</p>
    <p>However, please note: unless you are making changes to or
       need to debug <span class="command">updatebrowsedb.pl</span>, you should use the &quot;wrapper&quot; shell
       script provided in the same subdirectory. This wrapper is called <span class="command">ub</span> and
       was written to ensure that <span class="command">updatebrowsedb.pl</span></p>
    <ul>
       <li>is
             run from the &quot;release&quot; directory and not from a particular developer's
          directory (for more information about a development environment which
          uses multiple developers' directories and environments, <a href="../program/devenvironment.html">click
          here</a>) </li>
       <li>runs with  certain environment variables properly set</li>
       <li>assumes the use of the &quot;production&quot; row, if no row is specified, when
          setting the host from which data will be read</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="command">$DLXSROOT/bin/browse/ub -C class -c collection [ -r
       row [ -h host ] ] [ -f ] [ -p ]</p>
    <ul>
       <li>-f : is optional but if supplied, the wrapper will run the updatebrowsedb.pl
          script without asking for confirmation </li>
       <li>-p : is used to &quot;purge&quot; all records from the browse tables for a
          particular collection without re-populating (updating) the collection's
          browse information</li>
       <li>-r : the row is optional. Without it, the &quot;production&quot; row will
          be assumed and used.</li>
       <li>-h : if row is supplied, host is optional. The script will force updatebrowsedb.pl
          to use the host given. If no row is supplied, host cannot be supplied. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If, for any reason, you must override the assumptions made by the &quot;wrapper&quot;
       script, you can always run the updatebrowsedb.pl directly by entering: </p>
    <p class="command">$DLXSROOT/bin/browse/updatebrowsedb.pl class=AAA c=BBB
       host=CCC row=DDD</p>
    <p>where <span class="command">AAA</span> is either &quot;text&quot; or &quot;image&quot;;; <span class="command">BBB</span> is
       the collection id of the collection you want to create browsing for; <span class="command">CCC</span> is
      the name of the host on which resides the XPAT index for the collection
       (this is not relevant to ImageClass, which uses MySQL for all queries);
       and <span class="command">DDD</span> is
       key to the row in the database you wish to use (production, dlxsadm, or
       an individual developer's id). For example, you may want to point the
       script at new or test data on a machine that is different from your production
       machine. You could accomplish this by changing the <span class="command">host</span> or <span class="command">devhost</span> field
       for the collection in the collmgr. NOTE: If <a href="../program/devenvironment.html#workdirs">DLPS_DEV</a> is
       set when you invoke <span class="command">updatebrowsedb.pl</span> (without
       the wrapper <span class="command">ub</span>), the <span class="command">devhost</span> field
       will be used; otherwise, the 
       <span class="command">host</span> field will be used. </p>
