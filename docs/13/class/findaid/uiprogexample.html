    <div class="pageTitle">Programming Example: Adding Elements to the Results Display </div>
    
    <p class="alert">Beginnings of a section describing User interface programming.</p>
    
    <p>Following is an edited version of a support email describing
    how to make additional elements from a finding aid appear in the
    results display.  As such it may give you the flavor of the
    programming techniques needed to modify the behavior of the
    middleware at a fairly low level. Reading through this example
    deliberately should guide you through all the steps needed for
    this, which is just a specific instance of the general way a
    search set and a result set get things added to them, how the
    result set gets that new thing filtered and added to the output
    XML and finally how the XSL is used to get that XML out to HTML.
</p>
    
<p>When one clicks on one of the links in the left-hand "outline" on a
"standard view", the middleware does an XPat search for the container,
or other region (seen as the <code>focusrgn</code> parameter on the
URL) that contains a particular byte offset (the link having been
created by the middleware when it created the "standard view".</p>

<p>If you add a <code>debug=xml</code> to that URL, you should see something like:

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;FullTextResults>
  &lt;Results>
    &lt;DocContent>
      &lt;RegionContent>
         &lt;controlaccess>
....
       &lt;/controlaccess>
....
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Look at <code>DLXSROOT/web/f/findaid/text.xml</code>, which is the
file used by the "standard" view.  (Note that you can always see what
files are in play by adding a <code>debug=tpl</code> to the URL.)  In
this file you should see the following snippet of XML:

<blockquote><pre>
  &lt;FullTextResults>
    &lt;DocEncodingType>&lt;?DOC_ENCODING_TYPE_XML?>&lt;/DocEncodingType>
    &lt;Results>&lt;?RESULTS_XML?>&lt;/Results>
  &lt;/FullTextResults>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>It is the <code>RESULTS_XML</code> PI that is filled in with
everything from <code>DocContent</code> onward. In this case, searches have been
done by the middleware, at some point the EAD
<code>controlaccess</code> region was searched for by the middleware
and returned by XPat.</p>

In <code>text.xsl</code>, which is used to transform the
<code>text.xml</code> data, you will find:
<blockquote><pre>
          &lt;xsl:when test="$FocusRegion = 'controlaccess'">
            &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="controlaccess"/>
          &lt;/xsl:when>
</pre>
</blockquote>

The template for <code>controlaccess</code> is in <code>text.components.xsl</code>.

To add this to the "Search terms in context" view, we have to make
sure that <code>reslist.xml</code>, which is what is used for that
view (again <code>debug=tpl</code> will show that), has to have a PI
that triggers a handler that eventually requests XPat to do a search
for the <code>controlaccess</code> within the finding aid in question.</p>

<p>There is a <code>RESULTS_XML</code> PI in
<code>reslist.xml</code>. So, what we have to do is make sure that,
for a "search terms in context" view, (i.e., CGI params:
<code>view=reslist;subview=detail</code>), the <code>RESULTS_PI</code>
triggers not only the header and the hits "kwics" (aka keywords in
context) and all the containers and other top level elements that
include those kwics, but also the <code>controlaccess</code>
element.</p>

<p>A useful technique is to run under the Perl debugger with the URL
parameters and follow through the code. In this case, with
<code>view=reslist;subview=detail</code>, <code>FindaidApp.pm</code>
takes us to <code>DetailViewSearchesAndFilter_XML</code>.  From there
to <code>FindaidClass::SubmitItemKwicSearches</code>.  This leads us
to <code>DLXSROOT/lib/DLXSApp/FullTextApp::DetailViewSearches</code>
and this goes to <code>FindaidClass::DoDetailResultsSearches</code>.
This in turn uses
<code>DLXSROOT/lib/DLXSClass/FullTextClass::AddSimpleSearches</code>
(or <code>AddBooleanSearches</code>). This adds "ScopingHeads", that
is, the containers and such that contain the kwics.</p>

<p>Having gone through all that code, you can see how the kwics and their
"ScopingHeads" are added to the search set. Finally, the search set is
submitted (back up in
<code>FindaidClass::DoDetailResultsSearches</code>) and the results
are added to an <code>XPatResultSet</code>.</p>

<p>Later, the result set is filtered. As in all cases, the result set is
an iterator and the results one by one are handed to the middleware,
in occurrence order, so that a container head will come before any
kwics within that container and so on.</p>

<p>So, you'll want to subclass <code>FindaidClass.pm</code> (see <a
href="../../program/subclassing.html">this reference to writing DLXS
subclasses</a>) so that you can override of
<code>SubmitItemKwicSearches</code>. In that method, you add a call to
a routine that will add, to the search set called 'kwicresults', a
search for the proper additional <code>controlaccess</code> region
within your finding aid.</p>

<p>Then comes the filtering step.  You will need to add an extra
<code>elsif</code> block to the method
<code>ScopedDetailResultsFilter_XML</code> in your
<code>FindaidClass.pm</code> subclass.  You'll see that there are
various <code>if, elsif</code> blocks that check for different labels
(added at search time) so that the code knows how to package/filter
the result for output to the XML file. Your new <code>elsif</code>
will check for results with a label (such as "additionalcontrolaccess"
or some such) and add the returned XML to the output results.</p>

<p>Then of course, you'll probably have to deal with some XSL to filter
the new <code>controlaccess</code> region in a way that fits the
output for this HTML page rather than the "focused region" type of
"standard view" output for "subject terms/controlaccess."</p>
