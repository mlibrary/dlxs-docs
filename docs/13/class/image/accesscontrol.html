<p>The document on <a href="../../auth/index.html">DLXS Authentication and Authorization</a> covers in depth what you need to do to set up access control for all of DLXS, including Image Class. </p>

<p>A special Image Class option allows collections that are unrestricted at  the collection level, to have  
    individually identified full-size images restricted at the record level. A good 
    example of this is the <a href="http://images.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?c=musart">University 
    of Michigan, Museum of Art</a>. Authorized users (University of Michigan
    faculty, staff, students) have unrestricted (collection level) access to
    all text records, thumbnail images, and full size images. Those using the
    collection from outside the range of valid umich IP addresses are allowed
    to access all text records, all thumbnail images, and most full-size images,
    but are restricted from viewing some full-size images that are identified
    in the item level record as being restricted (due to
    copyright in the case of the Museum).</p>
<p>Item level access information is stored in
  the <strong>m_entryauth</strong> field of the <strong><a href="mediatable.html">media table</a></strong>.  </p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width="75">Value</th>
      <th>Restriction</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>world</td>
      <td>unrestricted access to full-size images.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[collid]</td>
      <td>access to full-size images restricted to authorized users of the collection.
        note: use the actual collid, not "[collid]".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>no access</td>
      <td>access to full-size image is completely restricted. nobody can see
        it.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Keep in mind that if the collection is restricted to an authorized group of users at the collection level, the Image Class middleware will not allow unauthorized users to access the image, no matter what the ENTRYAUTH says.</p>

<p>The value of <strong>ENTRYAUTH</strong> is established at the time the
   data records are loaded to MySQL. The value can be specified
  globally (for an entire collection). Global configuration is  in the entryauth
  field of the CollMgr record.</p>
<p>It is also possible for each record/ENTRY to 
  have the ENTRYAUTH specified independently. This allows <i>some</i> full-size
   images to be available to the world, and others to be restricted to certain
   user groups. In order for this to be utilized, the source data must have
  a field dedicated to specifying access restrictions for the full-size images
  associated with the record, and the field must be mapped
  to the "DLXS_ea" Administrative Field Mappings.</p>
<p><a href="mysql.html#itemaccess">Administrative Field Mapping</a> is done in the <strong>field_admin_maps</strong>  CollMgr field.</p>
<p>Currently, if the value of the field mapped to DLXS_ea is "www" or "world" 
  (not case sensitive) then the ENTRYAUTH will be set to "WORLD" in the SGML&#0160;file.
</p>
<p>If the value of the field mapped to DLXS_ea is &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;no access&quot; (not
  case sensitive) then the ENTRYAUTH will be set to &quot;no access&quot;. </p>
<p>Any other value in the DLXS.ea mapped field will result in the ENTRYAUTH MALLOW
     being set to the value of the third field of the coll-info.txt file. </p>
<p>See <a href="accesstable.html">Image Class Access Control Summary and 
  Examples Table</a> for useful examples.</p>
<h2>Access Restriction by Image Size</h2>
<p>Restriction of image access by size is also possible by setting the value
  of <strong>imgsizemax</strong> and <strong>imgsizemin</strong> in <strong>Collmgr</strong>.
  This is especially useful with JPEG2000 and MrSID files when the largest size
  is very large and putting a limit on the viewable size is desireable. Please
  see the help text within Collmgr for more information and allowable values. </p>
<p>As of DLXS 12a, it is possible
  to allow a specific list of users to have access to all sizes of images/media,
  even if a size limit has been placed using imgsizemax. This is done by listing
  userids in the <strong>privileged_users</strong> <strong>Collmgr</strong> field.
  This, therefore, requires an authentication mechanism of some sort (see <a href="../../auth/index.html">DLXS
  Authentication and Authorization</a>).</p>
