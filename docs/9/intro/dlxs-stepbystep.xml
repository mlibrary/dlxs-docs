<PRE>
   Welcome to DLXS Installer.  Press 'q' at any time to quit
       Compatible with DLXS Release 9.

   Which platform are you using? (SunOS/Linux/AIX) [SunOS]
</PRE>

<P><I>The preceding is a check to make sure the platform is supported.</I></P>

<PRE>Where is Perl installed? [/usr/bin/perl]</PRE>
<P><I>Enter the full path to perl. The default is from the 'which' command..</I></P>

<PRE>
   Checking for Perl installation for required modules...
   All required modules were found.
</PRE>

<P><I>All required Perl modules were found. If any were missing or
if any differed from the recommended versions, the Installer
would have listed them. We recommend installing them beforehand. You
may abort the install at this point (Ctrl-C) and restart it later.</I></P>

<PRE>
   The next series of questions concerns where certain
   required binaries are installed in your system.
</PRE>

<P><I>Enter full paths to the binaries you choose to install based on the middleware classes you chose to install as directed. See <A HREF="dlxs-install.xml#binaries">Binaries</A>.</I></P>

<PRE>
   Where is XPAT installed? [/l/local/bin/xpat] 

   Do you want to use tif2web (required for TextClass page viewer)? [Y] 
   Where is tif2web installed? [/l/local/bin/tif2web] 

   Do you want to use c42pdf (required for TextClass page viewer)? [Y] 
   Where is c42pdf installed? [/l/local/bin/c42pdf] 

   Do you want to use MrSid (required for ImageClass)? [Y] 
   Where is mrsid_retrieve installed? [/l/local/bin/mrsid_retrieve] 


        **********************************

        **********************************

  The next question allows you to pick between performing a first-time
  installation or reconfiguring an existing installation.

  For a FIRST-TIME INSTALLATION you will be asked where to install DLXS.
  You should supply a full path.  For example, if you choose
  /l1/dlxs-release-9, the installer will:

        (1) create an install directory named /l1/dlxs-release-9
        (2) mark it with a timestamp
        (3) extract the tarfiles into that directory.

  The directory path you choose will be known as DLXSROOT.

  This install directory is also inserted as a string into a number
  of working and configuration example files.

  For your webserver, the DLXSROOT variable and its value are written to
  an example file called DLXSROOT/bin/installer/config-examples/httpd.conf.dlxs.

  You may use that example configuration file to configure your Apache
  server environment. Or you may define DLXSROOT for your server using
  your own configuration.

  For your Unix shell, you should set the DLXSROOT environment variable
  to the path you choose so you can run various command line utilities
  which depend on it.

  For a RECONFIGURATION, you will be asked for the path you entered for
  the FIRST-TIME INSTALLATION directory.  The directory must be one
  containing a completed installation of DLXS Release 9.

  Is this an I)nitial install or a R)econfiguration? (I/R) [I]

  Where would you like to install DLXS? [//] /l1/dlxstest
</PRE>

<P><I>This is where you specify DLXSROOT as explained above. Note the option to "re-configure". If you choose it, you will be prompted for the location of a completed installation. The installer will then make another pass over the installed middleware .cfg files allowing you to change values you entered during the initial installation or subsequent reconfigurations. You can do this as many times as necessary.</I></P>

the middleware can find them easily and we can avoid many inline replacements at install-time. </I></P>

<PRE> 
  no authentication URL available: using Basic Auth
</PRE>

<P><I>By default, we assume you do not have a URL to an authentication system at your site that is able to set the REMOTE_USER environment variable. We deliver an HTTP "Basic Auth" configuration in the virtual host example file $DLXSROOT/bin/installer/config-examples/ httpd.conf.dlxs file.</I></P>

<PRE>
  Select the Collection database type (CSV/MySQL) [MySQL] CSV
</PRE>
<P><I>Though the default shown is MySQL, to run "out of the box," choose CSV to use the sample database tables and collections.  If you choose CSV, and at some later time you wish to begin running under MySQL, run the <a href="../collmeta/dlxs-dbmove.xml"><b>dbmove</b></a> utility to transfer the contents of the supplied CSV database into MySQL.  If you have already set up MySQL and used the database conversion utility <B><A HREF="../collmeta/dlxs-dbconv.xml">dbconv</A></B> to populate it, choose MySQL.</I></P>

<PRE>
  Enter your SMTP host [mail.umdl.umich.edu]

 Enter CSV session directory [/tmp/sessions] 

 Enter CSV session lock directory [/tmp/sessionslock] 
</PRE>

<P><I>Sessions can be maintained in CSV files or in a MySQL database. If in CSV, enter the directory and lock directory where session files live (<TT>sessions</TT> and <TT>sessionslock</TT>. These directories must exist and be write permitted to the UID of the web server and should be created post-install.</I></P>

<P><I>The mail host to use when mailing BookBag contents.</I></P>

<PRE>
  Enter the email address from which the BookBag mail will be sent 
   	["UMDL Mailer" &lt;umdl-help@umich.edu&gt;] 

  Configuring collmgr.cfg (Collection Database Manager)

  no logout URL: using Basic Auth
</PRE>

<P><I>As explained above, the collmgr needs to have REMOTE_USER set by some mechanism. By default we supply HTTP "Basic Auth".</I></P>

<PRE>
  Configuring dbconv.cfg

  Configuring dbmove.cfg

  Configuring textclass.cfg

  Configuring PageView.cfg

  Select the *Pageviewer* datastore type.

  If you don't have page images but want to try sample data, 
   	choose CSV (CSV/MySQL) [MySQL] 
</PRE>

<P><I>A sample Pageview database table is supplied for the sampleic collection. For any significant application, CSV will not scale. If you just want to try the sampletc collection choose CSV. If you have a large scale collection of page images, choose MySQL.</I></P>

  Done.

  Please refer to /l1/dlxstest/bin/installer/README-postinstall
  for post-installation directions.

  Would you like to view the post-installation directions now? [Y]

  ** NOTE: This installation was performed using version 9
  of the DLXS Installer **

  The middleware uses the DLXSROOT environment variable to locate
  its pieces in the install tree.  To run various command line utilities,
  make sure to set DLXSROOT environment variable for your Unix shell.

  Optionally, change permissions on /l1/dlxstest/web/t/text/gifcvtdir
  to make it accessible only to the UID of the webserver.

  Optionally, change permissions on files in /l1/dlxstest/misc/db to
  make them accessible only to the UID of the webserver. In any event,
  be sure the web server can read and write these files, e.g. make sure
  they are 666, if their UID/GID is not that of the web server user and
  group.
  
  For initial installations, if you chose MySQL for your database, you
  will want to use /l1/dlxstest/bin/db/dbmove to move the sample CSV database
  into your MySQL database before you try to run the sample data.
  
  If your session database type is CSV, create the sessions and
  sessionslock subdirectories in the locations you specified when
  configuring DlpsSession.cfg and permit them to the UID of the
  webserver.
  
  /l1/dlxstest/bin/installer/config-examples/httpd.conf.dlxs
  defines "Basic Auth" for an Apache server and thereby sets
  REMOTE_USER. If you disable this, BE WARNED: the collection manager
  requires some form of authentication which sets the REMOTE_USER
  environment variable for proper operation!
  
  To use the "Basic Auth" sample configuration you will need
  to edit /l1/dlxstest/bin/installer/config-examples/htpasswd.dlxs
  to supply the encrypted form of the password you choose for the
  dlxsadm administrative user to run collmgr.  See documentation in
  that file for instructions.
  
  You may remove /tmp/main.cfg to restore the original default
  Installer answers.  It is a copy of
  /l1/dlxstest/bin/installer/main.cfg modified by the install program to
  remember the answers you provide and, if present, is favored over
  the original.

  Set up cron jobs to run managesessions.pl and to clear the
  gifcvtdir pageviewer cache.
</PRE>

<P><I>The installation is complete. Please follow the
