<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>multirgn</B> takes two main arguments: the <I>data_dictionary</I> and the name of a file
identifying the tags that define the regions.
In one pass over the text, it produces a region index
file containing the region indices of all the
regions specified in the <I>tagname_file</I>.  The region index file has the
format described in the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+regions">regions</A></B>(5) man page.  By default, this region index
file is named with the same prefix as the <I>data_dictionary</I>, and with the suffix,
`.rgn'.  An alternate name can be specified using the <B>-o</B>
option, described below.  <B>multirgn</B> also updates (or creates) the `Region'
sections in the <I>data_dictionary</I> for the regions that it builds.

If the .rgn file already exists at the time <B>multirgn</B> is
invoked, <B>multirgn</B> will prompt the user to confirm that the existing
file can be overwritten.

<P>

Most text databases contain several types of <I>structural elements</I>.
The structural elements in a newspaper database may include, for
example, Stories, Headlines, Bylines, Dates and Paragraphs.  These
structural elements are known in <B>xpat</B> as <I>regions</I> and, in many
databases, are delimited by <I>tags</I>.
The tags are usually surrounded by angle brackets
(the characters `&lt;' and
`&gt;') to distinguish them from the main body of the text.
These tags commonly occur in start-end pairs, with the end tag being
distinguished from the start tag by a slash (`/') character after
the opening angle bracket.
<P>

For example, headings in a text might be tagged as:
<P>

<TT>  &lt;Heading&gt;The text of the heading&lt;/Heading&gt;</TT>
<P>

<B>multirgn</B> only recognizes tags using the above angle bracket syntax, and will
only write the region pointers for the regions delimited by the tags
specified in the <I>tagname_file</I>.
The format of that file is described below.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
<DT><B>-v1</B><DD>
Specify regular verbose mode.
This option tells <B>multirgn</B> to produce descriptive output concerning
its execution.  If this option is not specified, <B>multirgn</B> runs
silently, producing no output concerning its execution.
<DT><B>-v2</B><DD>
Specify second-level verbose mode.
This option tells <B>multirgn</B> to produce extra messages about subtler problems
in the data.  In particular, <B>multirgn</B> prints ``Mangled Tag Error'' messages
in <B>-v2</B> mode.  Note that in most cases, 
``Mangled Tag Error'' messages, are not needed, so <B>-v1</B> mode is adequate.
Refer to the section on ``Mangled Tag Errors'', below, for further
details.
<DT><B>-f</B><DD>
Specify full pathnames.
This option tells <B>multirgn</B> to use full paths in the `SysName' fields within
the `Region' sections of the Data Dictionary.  The `SysName' fields
specify the file that contains the actual region index pointers.  The
<B>-f</B> option is
useful to produce a Data Dictionary that can be accessed from any place in the filesystem.
By default, <B>multirgn</B> puts just the filename of the region (`.rgn') file in the
`SysName' fields.  In that configuration, the database can only be
accessed from the database directory itself.
<DT><B>-o</B> <I>output_prefix</I><DD>
Specify the output file prefix.  This option specifies the prefix of
the region pointer file that <B>multirgn</B> produces.  <B>multirgn</B> will add a `.rgn'
suffix to the given prefix to produce the complete region index
filename.  If the <I>output_prefix</I> already has a `.rgn'
extension, <B>multirgn</B> will not add another one.  <B>multirgn</B> will put the complete
filename in the `SysName' fields within the `Region' sections of the
Data Dictionary, for the regions that <B>multirgn</B> builds.

<DT><B>-merge</B><DD>

Enable <B>multirgn</B> to merge the new regions into the existing regions.

<DT><B>-sw</B> <I>tag_position_file</I><DD>
Specify sort and write mode.
This option tells <B>multirgn</B> to perform the sort and write stages only.  This
option allows the user to bypass <B>multirgn</B>'s initial phase that identifies the
starts and ends of regions.  This is useful in those special situations where
<B>multirgn</B>'s region start / end identification system (which just recognizes start
and end tags with the angle bracket syntax) is not powerful enough, and
users wish to
use their own custom region identification program instead.
In this configuration, the custom program is run to identify
the regions and to write their start and end offsets
to a <I>tag_position_file</I>.  Then, <B>multirgn</B> is run with the
<B>-sw</B> option to create a final region index from that
<I>tag_position_file</I> and the <I>tagname_file</I>.
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
The <I>tag_position_file</I> consists of a series of five-byte entries in
the following format: the first byte is a one-byte integer whose value
is the 0-based entry number in the <I>tagname_file</I>.
The remaining four bytes are a four-byte integer whose value is a
0-based offset into the text.  These offsets are alternately interpreted
as the starts and the ends of the regions hat the regions.
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
The following example shows the <I>tag_position_file</I> that <B>multirgn</B>'s region
identification system produces (in a complete run, <B>multirgn</B> first creates a
<I>tag_position_file</I> and then runs the sort-and-write phase
automatically). Assume the <I>tagname_file</I> contains
the following two lines:
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
<PRE>
     Hdr
     Story
</PRE>

<P>
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
Also, assume the text consists of the following line.
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
<PRE>
     &lt;Story&gt;&lt;Hdr&gt;this&lt;/Hdr&gt;is&lt;Hdr&gt;done&lt;/Hdr&gt;&lt;/Story&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
<B>multirgn</B>'s region identification system identifies the following regions on
the text:
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
<PRE>
     &lt;Story&gt;&lt;Hdr&gt;this&lt;/Hdr&gt;is&lt;Hdr&gt;done&lt;/Hdr&gt;&lt;/Story&gt;
     ^      ^             ^  ^             ^       ^
     |      +---- Hdr ----+  +---- Hdr ----+       |
     |                                             |
     +-------------------- Story ------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
The <I>tag_position_file</I> it builds contains the following six values:
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
<PRE>
  Entry  Byte 1    Bytes 2-5
  -----  ------    ---------
    1      0           0     (Interpreted as Start Story)
    2      1           7     (Interpreted as Start Hdr)
    3      1          21     (Interpreted as End Hdr)
    2      1          24     (Interpreted as Start Hdr)
    3      1          38     (Interpreted as End Hdr)
    4      0          46     (Interpreted as End Story)
</PRE>

<P>
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
Under the <B>-sw</B> option, <B>multirgn</B> uses the <I>tagname_file</I>
to determine the region names corresponding to the `Byte 1'
values, above.  Therefore, `0' would correspond to `Hdr'
and `1' would correspond to `Story'.
<DT><B>-meta</B> <I>meta_structure_file</I><DD>
Construct only the meta regions and the Default Data region.
This option only applies to MFS databases.
The <I>meta_structure_file</I> is a special file generated by <B>mfsmeta</B>.
This file contains information that allows <B>multirgn</B> to restrict the region
building operation to specific portions of the text.
Refer to the <B>MFS Database Regions</B> section, below, for
details.
<DT><B>-displayfmt</B> <I>format_name</I><DD>
Construct regions within those files having
the same DisplayFmt as specified by <I>format_name</I>.
This option only applies to MFS database and may only be used in
conjunction with the `<B>-meta</B>' option.
Refer to the <B>MFS Database Regions</B> section, below, for details.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TAGNAME FILE FORMATS</H2>

The <I>tagname_file</I> can be in one of two formats.  In the plain-text 
format, the bodies of the tags which enclose the different regions are listed
in the <I>tagname_file</I>, one tag body (and hence one region) per line, with
no other markup.
For example, a <I>tagname_file</I> containing the lines,
<P>

<TT>Heading
<BR>

Section</TT>

<P>
instructs <B>multirgn</B> to search for regions defined by the tag pairs
<TT>&lt;Heading HREF=&quot;1&quot;&gt; .. &lt;/Heading&gt;</TT> ... <TT>&lt;PB&gt;&lt;Section&gt; .. &lt;/Section&gt;</TT>.
Each region has the same name as the body of its defining tag. 
However, this format provides no mechanism to index attributes 
or empty tags such as &lt;PB&gt;.
<P>
The second format is called the encoded-text format. Note that the
encoding _is_ case sensitive.
The following is an example of an encoded-text <I>tagname_file</I>.
<P>
<PRE>
<TT>
  &lt;region&gt;
    &lt;element&gt;Heading&lt;/element&gt;
    &lt;element&gt;Section&lt;/element&gt;
  &lt;/region&gt;
  &lt;region&gt;
    &lt;tag&gt;PB&lt;/tag&gt;
  &lt;/region&gt;
  &lt;region&gt;
    &lt;att&gt;HREF&lt;/att&gt;
  &lt;/region&gt;
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the tags which define the regions are the same as the
plain-text format example:
&lt;Heading HREF=&quot;1&quot;&gt;..&lt;/Heading&gt; ... &lt;PB&gt;&lt;Section&gt;..&lt;/Section&gt;.
However, this format also supports indexing of the HREF attribute (which will
be identified with a region name of &quot;A-HREF&quot; in the <I>data_dictionary</I> file), 
and indexing of the empty tag 
&lt;PB&gt; element (which will be identified with a region name of &quot;PB-T&quot;
in the <I>data_dictionary</I> file). Elements
defined within the &lt;element&gt; region can also be defined within the &lt;tag&gt; 
region, in order to index only the tag in addition the tag data region.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Note:</B><DD>
No command line switch is necessary to tell <B>multirgn</B> what the
<I>tagname_file</I> format is; <B>multirgn</B> detects the format
automatically and processes the file accordingly.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MFS DATABASE REGIONS</H2>

<P>

In MFS databases, the
MFS system creates  a ``virtual text'' from the text of all the files
in the database.  The portion of this virtual text that corresponds to
each file consists of three pieces: the Meta-Header section, the Data
section and the
Meta-Trailer section.  This breakdown is illustrated in the following
diagram:
<P>
<PRE>
<TT>
  &lt;OTDoc&gt;&lt;OTMeta&gt;....&lt;/OTMeta&gt;&lt;OTData&gt;........&lt;/OTData&gt;&lt;/OTDoc&gt;
  |---------- Meta-Header -----------|| Data ||- Meta-Trailer -|
  ^                                   ^       ^                ^
  start                               start   start            end
  header                              data    trailer          pos
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>

If <B>multirgn</B> is run over such a database,
it will build a region index for each tag defined in the
<I>tagname_file</I>.  It will search for these tags in all three of the
above sections in each file.
While this behaviour is usually adequate, the region-building process
can usually be made more accurate and efficient by building the
regions in several passes, restricting the build operation to specific
sections of the text in each pass.  The <B>-meta</B> and
<B>-displayfmt</B> options provide detailed control over this
process.
<P>

When the <B>-meta</B> option is specified alone (i.e., without the
<B>-displayfmt</B> option) <B>multirgn</B> only builds regions on the text in
the Meta-Trailer and
Meta-Header sections.  Within those sections, it builds regions on the
tags defined by the <I>tagname_file</I>.  It skips the Data
sections.
<P>

The argument to the <B>-meta</B> option is a
<I>meta_structure_file</I>, which contains the offsets of the Meta-Header,
Data and Meta-Tailer sections, and a few other pieces of information
for each file.  This file is built by the <B>mfsmeta</B> program.  Refer to the
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+mfsmeta">mfsmeta</A></B>(1) man page for further details on this file.
<P>

This type of restriction is
useful because the MFS system can usually produce the text of the
Meta-Header and Meta-Trailer sections
much faster than the text in the Data
sections.  Also, the Data sections may not contain any regions in the
first place, which means that scanning over that text should be
avoided.  Under this configuration, it builds regions on the tags
defined by the <I>tagname_file</I>.
As such, the <I>tagname_file</I>
should be set up with the following meta-fields:


<PRE>

OTDoc
OTMeta
OTFile
OTDate
OTTime
OTDisplayFmt
OTFieldsSize
OTFields
OTData

</PRE>



The <I>tagname_file</I> should also be set up to build regions on any
User Meta-Data fields in the OTFields sections.
<P>

In addition to the regions defined by the <I>tagname_file</I>, <B>multirgn</B> also
builds a special OTDefaultData region.  This
region defines an appropriate unit of text to send to a
viewer program, within the Data section of each file.  For most word
processor files, this consists of the entire Data
section.  However, for tagged text files that contain several
``Entries'' (e.g., newspaper Stories), an individual Entry might be
more appropriate.  Because MFS databases may contain both type
of files, a special
field in the Data Dictionary may be used to control how <B>multirgn</B> builds the
OTDefaultData region.
<P>

Each FilterChain section in the Data Dictionary
may contain an OTDefaultDataTag field.
If a given FilterChain section does not contain an
OTDefaultDataTag field, <B>multirgn</B> will make the entire Data section
of the corresponding files the OTDefaultData
region.  If a
FilterChain section does have an OTDefaultDataTag field
defined, <B>multirgn</B> will scan the corresponding files' Data sections and will
build the OTDefaultData regions on the tags defined by the
OTDefaultDataTag field.  In this way, the members of the
OTDefaultData region are appropriate for each file.
<P>

<P>

The second configuration involves specifying the
<B>-displayfmt</B> option in addition to the <B>-meta</B> option.
With both options specified, <B>multirgn</B> restricts the region build operation
to the Data sections of those files whose DisplayFmt matches the
given <I>format_name</I>.  Under such a configuration, the
<I>tagname_file</I> should be set up with the tags that are present in
those particular Data sections.
<P>

By using these two configurations, the first pass can be used to
build the meta-field tags and then one or more subsequent passes can
be used to build regions on the Data section sections of specific
file types.
<P>
<B>&quot;NESTING PROBLEMS&quot;</B>

<P>
<P>

<B>multirgn</B> is designed to operate on text in which the tags are properly paired and
the tag pairs are properly nested. However, it 
handles overlapping tag pairs and recursive nestings automatically.
<P>
<B>Overlapping Pairs</B>

<P>
<P>

Although invalid SGML, multirgn will correctly index overlapping pairs, 
which are patterns of the form:
<P>
<PRE>
<TT>  &lt;Body&gt;&lt;Tag1&gt;text text&lt;Tag2&gt;text text&lt;/Tag1&gt;text text&lt;/Tag2&gt;&lt;/Body&gt;</TT>


<B>Recursive Nestings:</B>


Recursive nestings are patterns of the form

<TT>  &lt;Body&gt;&lt;Tag1&gt;text text&lt;Tag1&gt;text text&lt;/Tag1&gt;text text&lt;/Tag1&gt;&lt;/Body&gt;</TT> 
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, <B>multirgn</B> will index each occurrence of the tag, but does not 
provide any explicit indexing to assist the XPAT search engine to
locate the inner nest (i.e. ''region Tag1 within region Tag1'').

<P>
<B>multirgn</B> will issue a warning message if the nested tags are not symmetric:
<P>
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying&nbsp;to&nbsp;pop&nbsp;unpushed&nbsp;tag&nbsp;Tag2,&nbsp;input&nbsp;offset&nbsp;53&nbsp;stack:&nbsp;/Body
<P>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MANGLED TAG ERRORS</H2>

<P>

If the <B>-v2</B> option is specified, <B>multirgn</B> will print a warning
message whenever it encounters what it considers to be ``mangled tags''.
<B>multirgn</B> considers opening angle brackets (`&lt;' characters) that are
not the start of tags to be mangled tags.  Whenever it encounters
such occurrences, it simply ignores them and keeps on processing
(which is usually the correct behaviour).
<P>

The following segment of text contains an example of a `&lt;'
character in a location other than the start of a tag:
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...described&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;relation,&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;y,&nbsp;and&nbsp;having&nbsp;the...

<P>
If the <B>-v2</B> option is specified <B>multirgn</B> would report the following
error when it encountered the above segment of text (NNN is the
offset of the `&lt;' character):
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mangled&nbsp;tag&nbsp;error&nbsp;at&nbsp;offset&nbsp;NNN

<P>
This message is basically a warning to alert the Database Administrator
that the data contains `&lt;' characters at places other than tags. 
For this reason, the <B>-v2</B> option should only be specified if the
data is not expected to contain `&lt;' characters in places
other than tags.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MERGING INDEX FILES</H2>


Before <B>multirgn</B> starts building the regions, it scans the existing
`Region' sections in the <I>data_dictionary</I> and verifies that the region index files
that they reference exist.  If any of those files are missing, <B>multirgn</B>
deletes the corresponding `Region' sections from the <I>data_dictionary</I>.  In this
way, integrity is maintained between the <I>data_dictionary</I> and the region index
file.
<P>


If the region index file that <B>multirgn</B> writes the index to already exists,
<B>multirgn</B> will write the new index points onto the end of the index file.
If region pointers for a particular region already exists in the
region index file, <B>multirgn</B> will remove them from where they exist in
the index file and will place the new pointers on the end of the
index file.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MULTIRGN AND XPATRGN</H2>

<P>

In many situations, it will be necessary to use both <B>multirgn</B> and
<B>xpatrgn</B> to define all the regions in a production database.
While <B>multirgn</B> is vastly preferable for those regions which nest
nicely and are unambiguously tagged (usually the majority), there are
often other regions which are not defined unambiguously by tags or which
may overlap other regions.
In these situations it is best to build all the tagged regions with one <B>multirgn</B>
run and to follow that with several <B>xpatrgn</B> runs to build the remaining
regions.

<H2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MULTIRGN AND SGMLRGN</H2>

<P>
<B>multirgn</B> differs from <B>sgmlrgn</B> in several ways: 
(1) Because it does not validate the text, it produces output much faster.
(2) <B>multirgn</B> can possibly create smaller index files if only a subset of the regions are defined. 
(3) <B>multirgn</B> does not fabricate new region names if regions of the same name are nested. 
(4) <B>multirgn</B> infers an empty element if it is defined as a &lt;tag&gt; and not an &lt;element&gt;. Because of this, <B>multirgn</B> will only generate tag regions (e.g. &quot;TAG-T&quot;) and not element regions (e.g. &quot;TAG&quot;) for empty elements, while <B>sgmlrgn</B> will generate both.
