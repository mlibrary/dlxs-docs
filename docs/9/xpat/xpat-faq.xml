<DT>Is XPAT designed to take advantage of multiple processors?</DT><DD><P>The XPAT server isn't multi-threaded, and so can't take advantage of multi-processor systems in the way that a truly multi-threaded application can.  However, that's not to say that a multi-processor system won't give you a performance advantage in the multi-user environment. That is, parallel XPAT processes for different search requests will be load-balanced across the available CPUs by the operating system. They are <I>not</I> queued, as in a database environment. They are separate independent processes.</P>
<P>In some quick testing I've confirmed that Solaris migrates running processes to different CPUs (and probably Linux does too), giving further load-balancing.  Thus the performance gain you should expect would be nearly linear with the number of processors ("nearly" because there are shared resources such as memory which would probably prevent a truly linear relationship), although this would only be realized when the number of active users equals or exceeds the number of processors. That is, if there is only one search, it's going to go at full speed on a single processor. However if another comes along, it too will go full-speed on the second processor, independent of the first. Thus the performance gain in that situation over a uniprocessor system would be, from the perspective of the user, approximately double.</P>
<P>Incidentally, everything we buy for production is quad-CPU. We're overconfigured in some areas and under- in others, and it's all a function of your expected usage and collection size. For multi-user systems in general, though, I personally prefer multiple CPUs. (csnavely, 2001-05-02)</P></DD>
<DT>Can I get a free "trial" copy of XPAT?</DT><DD>No, I'm afraid we're not permitted to do that.  Our contract for the source code and rights for development and distribution restricts us from making XPAT available without a license and fees. (jpwilkin, 2001-05-02)</DD>
<DT>I represent a commercial (i.e., not a non-profit) organization, and am interested in acquiring XPAT.  Are you allowed to sell to for-profit organizations?</DT><DD>Our current contract restricts us to selling XPAT to the "vertical market represented by other academic institutions and non-profit/not-for-profit organizations."  Nevertheless, we are attempting to renegotiate this clause, so please check back. (jpwilkin, 2001-05-02)</DD>
