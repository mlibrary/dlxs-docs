			<H1>Overview</H1>
			<P>This document discusses the procedure to upgrade to version 2 of the metadata database used by DLXS version 9.  The intent of the document is to outline strategies and specific procedures to accomplish a successful upgrade of the dlxs database.</P>
			<P>Below is a series of steps to follow when upgrading your database.  In order to update to version 2 of the database, you must have a version 1 of the database.  If you have a version 1 of the database, go to Step 3.  If you do not have a version 1 of the database, start at Step 1.  The idea with the database upgrades is that in order to get from an  older version of the database to  the current, you need to run through each upgrade procedure up to the current.  Note that the script to upgrade from version 1 to 2 is called upgrade_1_2, for subsequent upgrades, the scripts will have similiar names, such as upgrade_2_3, and so on.</P>
			<H2>Step 1.  To upgrade to Version 1 of the database</H2>
			<P>To upgrade to version 1 of the database, you need run <I>$DLXRROOT/bin/db/dconv</I>.  This script will copy all the data in the colldb and groups files used by image, bib, and text class into a CSV database.  The CSV database created will be in <I>$DLXSROOT/misc/db</I> directory.</P>
			<H2>Step 2.  CVS vs MySQL</H2>
			<P>Now that you have copied all your data from the colldb and groups file into a CSV database, you can have the middleware access this metadata database.  But if you have a MySQL installation at your site, you may wish to move the CSV installation to a MySQL database.  To do this you can run the script <I>$DLXSROOT/bin/db/dbmove –s CSV –t MySQL</I> (the s stands for source, and the t for target).  Before you do this you will need to create a database by the name of dlxs, and two users for this database with specific privileges,   These users are <I>dlxs</I>, and <I>dlxsadm</I>.  Refer to the <A HREF="dlxs-colldatabases.xml#interaction">section of the DLXS documentation on database users</A> to get more information about setting up the privileges for these users. </P>
			<P>If at any time you wish to move back to a CSV database, you can run the command <I>$DLXSROOT/bin/db/dbmove –s MySQL –t CSV</I>.  Just make sure that the <I>$DLXSROOT/misc/db</I> directory is empty and that the script has permissions to write to it.</P>
			<H2>Step 3.  To upgrade to version 2 of the database from version 1</H2>
			<P>If you need to upgrade version 1 of the database to version 2, you will need to use the script <I>$DLXSROOT/bin/db/upgrade_1_2</I>.   <I>$DLXSROOT/bin/db/upgrade_1_2</I> can be run against either a MySQL database or a CSV database. </P>
			<P>To upgrade a MySQL database enter <I>$DLXSROOT/bin/db/upgrade_1_2 –d MySQL</I>.  Notice that the upgrade will try to backup the MySQL database into the directory <I>$DLXSROOT/misc/MySQL_DB_Backup</I> before performing the upgrade.  This is done just in case something goes wrong, you’ll have a backup of the database.  From the backup, you should be able to use the MySQL <I>mysqlimport</I> script to recover your database if you need to.</P>
			<P>To upgrade a CSV database enter <I>$DLXSROOT/bin/db/upgrade_1_2 –d CSV</I>.  Notice that the upgrade will try to backup the CSV database into the directory <I>$DLXSROOT/misc/CSV_DB_Backup</I> before performing the upgrade.  This is done just in case something goes wrong, you’ll have a backup of the database.  </P>
			<P>Once the upgrade is completed you should have a version 2 of the metadata database that is compatible with version 9 of the DLXS.</P>
