<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The Image Class DTD was designed specifically with information retrieval as the primary purpose. It is not very useful for general storage of image database data. It structures data for fast retrieval and filtering. Frequently used data is replicated for ready accessibility. For example, a database record that references 3 image files will be replicated 3 times in &lt;I&gt; (item) elements. The 3 instances are then clustered within an &lt;ENTRY&gt; element so they can be treated either as a single record or as 3 independent search results. The &lt;ISTRUCT&gt; element serves multple purposes.  It summarizes the most essential data points of an item so that items can quickly and easily be retrieved and displayed. This is very useful when displaying all of the images associated with a record/ENTRY because it eliminates the need to retrieve and filter the full items for each image.</P>

<H2>Elements</H2>
         <P>The <B>&lt;COLL&gt;</B> element
         provides an essential wrapper around the collection-specific
         SGML file and provides the primary location for the
         collection ID, which is replicated strategically through the
         SGML for easy access by the middleware.</P>

         <P>&#0160;The
         <B>&lt;GEN&gt;</B> element, for "general", holds information that
         applies to the entire collection, and which is often
         utilized by other elements.</P>

         <P>The <B>RULES, PROGR, DATA, and DATE</B> attributes of the 
         &lt;GEN&gt; element provide basic adminstrative data about
         the method used to create the SGML file. This data is not
         used in the information retrieval process.</P>

         <P>&#0160;The <B>&lt;ADMIN&gt;</B>
         elements, meaning "administrative," provide unique,
         abbreviated representations of the Administrative Field
         Mappings. These field mappings are used to flag certain
         critical fields of the database, such as the fields that
         hold image filenames and record ID numbers. Most of these
         mappings are only utilized in the process of generating the
         SGML. For example, the IS.fn mapping is used in the
         generation of the ISTRUCT element's &lt;M&gt; attribute (image file
         reference).</P>

         <P>The <B>&lt;META&gt;</B> elements
         establish unique abbreviations for the "meta" fields. 
         Collection-specific fields are mapped to the meta-fields as
         part of a high level field mapping process that ultimately
         enables cross collection searching.</P>

         <P>&#0160;The <B>&lt;BASE&gt;</B>
         elements establish unique abbreviations for the collection-specific field names. The abbreviations are used within the
         &lt;ITEM&gt;&#0160;elements to label fielded data.</P>

         <P>&#0160;The <B>&lt;ENTRY&gt;</B>
         element provides the outermost structure for the
         representation of a data record. The collection identifiers
         are replicated here to facilitate retrieval and filtering
         from SGML&#0160;to HTML for display. In cases where the
         record has multiple images associated with it, the &lt;ENTRY&gt;
         element binds together the information for each image, which
         is wrapped in the &lt;I&gt; (for "item") elements.</P>

         <P>&#0160;The <B>&lt;ENTRYAUTH&gt;</B>
         element aids in determining what groups of users are allowed
         to access the large size images associated with the record.
         It applies to all items in the &lt;ENTRY&gt; and is critical for
         authorization mechanisms of the CGI. See also <A HREF="image-accesstable.xml"> Image Class Access Control Summary and Examples Table</A>.</P>

         <P>&#0160;For every image of a
         record there is an <B>&lt;I&gt;</B> element, meaning "item". The
         attributes of the &lt;I&gt; element are essential to the
         information retrieval and the process of filtering data for
         display to the user. Each &lt;I&gt; element of a an
         &lt;ENTRY&gt; has the potential to be a single search
         result. The point being that while an &lt;ENTRY&gt;&#0160;is
         a complete representation of the original data record, the
         &lt;ITEM&gt; is the unit retrieved and displayed to the user
         by the middleware. </P>

         <P> The <B>&lt;INO&gt;</B> element is identical to the &lt;I&gt; element except that it is not searched nor displayed as a result. It is only retrieved and displayed as a related image to the record. The most common situation is where there is an overview image for a record as well as several detail images, and where it is preferable to only display the summary image as a search result.</P>

<P> The <B>&lt;ISTRUCT&gt;</B> element holds a summary of the most essential information about the image. This includes the image filename, caption, and whether or not the image file was present in the file system at the time of encoding. Additionally the ISTRUCT element holds structural metadata that describes the visual relationship of the image to the other images of the entry. For example, if the images of the entry combine to form a tiled matrix representing a larger whole, this is stored in the structural metadata. The structural metadata attributes are STID, FACE, STTY, X, and Y and they are described more fully in the document <A HREF="image-imagestructures.xml">Image Class - Mapping Image Structures</A>. </P>

         <P>&#0160;The <B>&lt;D&gt;</B> element
         provides a wrapper around the descriptive metadata of each
         item.</P>

         <P>&#0160;The <B>&lt;C&gt;</B> element,
         for "category", tags the fielded descriptive content of each
         record. The attributes utilize the unique abbreviations that
         were established in the &lt;GEN&gt; element in order to
         provide logical mappings of collection-specific fields to
         the general "meta" fields used for cross collection
         searching. The attributes are essential to formulating
         queries on specific fields, such as a search of the "Title"
         field. Furthermore, the abbreviations also appear in the
         HTML interface templates and are used by the middleware to
         populate placeholders with data.</P>

         <P>The <B>&lt;CNO&gt;</B> element is identical to the &lt;C&gt; element, though it is for fields that should not be searched. Situations exist where the content provider would like the field to be displayable, but not searchable.</P>
