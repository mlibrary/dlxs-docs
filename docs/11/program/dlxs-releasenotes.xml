      <H1>DLXS Release 11 - 5 DEC 2003</H1>
      <DIV2>
        <H2>General Information</H2>
        <P>DLXS Release 11 is comprised of:</P>
        <UL>

        <H2>Known Problems</H2>
        <DIV3>
          <P>XPAT 5.3.0 is generally backward-compatible with indexes generated by 5.2.x subject to a few isolated
misses during searching.  Re-indexing with 5.3 xpatbld resolves this deficiency.</P>
        </DIV3>
        <DIV3>
          <P>The SQL::Statement version 1.005 perl module is not backward compatible with version 0.1021.  Version 0.1021 was typical with Perl version 5.6.1 whereas 1.005 is typical of Perl 5.8.0. We recommend you install perl 5.8.0 and SQL::Statement 1.005 or higher.  The workaround mentioned below may not be required when SQL::Statement 1.006 becomes available.  Because of this the following constraints and workarounds apply.  </P>

            <LI>collmgr

                <LI>Incorrectly uppercases column names when moving MySQL to CSV under 1.005.  The workaround is to lower case the resulting column names using an ascii editor.</LI>

	  <H3>Image Class Known Problems</H3>
	  <UL>
	    <LI>A "q" CGI parameter without a value generates an error if it
	      is sequenced between two other "q" parameters that do have values. e.g.,
	      q1=house q2= q3=country. This can happen when there are 3 or more text
	      fields in a search form and the user enters text in only the first and
	      last.</LI>
	    <LI>Display of JPEG2000 images as JPEG in the browser behaves oddly if
	      the image is zoomed several times near the edge of the
	      full image. The zoomed portion of the image is stretched to match
	      the aspect ratio of the full-size image. </LI>
	    <LI>"rgn" CGI parameters containing full field names generate an
	      error. The CGI now expects field abbreviations, not full field
	      names.</LI>
	    <LI>The "MEDIAEQUIVS" PI in entry.tpl and bbentry.tpl appears (as the
	      string "MEDIAEQUIVS") in Netscape Navigator 4.x when it really should
	      be hidden if not utilized.</LI>

      <DIV2>
        <H2>XPAT version 5.3.0</H2>
        <DIV3>
          <UL>
            <LI>5.3.0 is a major new release of XPAT.  Two new binaries, <B>xpatbldu</B> and <B>xpatu</B> enable indexing and searching of UTF-8 encoded Unicode XML data.  Full Unicode support in the middleware will become available in a following release.   In addition, "Lite" <I>non-Unicode</I> versions of these tools together with sgmlrgn and multirgn are now freely available without license fees and may be downloaded from http://www.dlxs.org.</LI>
            <LI>5.3.0 is generally backward-compatible with indexes generated by 5.2.x subject to a few isolated
misses during searching.  5.3 can read 5.2 indexes albeit with a warning that it is not possible for 5.3 to determine whether the Data Dictionary has changed since the 5.2 index was built because the integrity checksum for 5.3 indexes is different than for 5.2.   </LI>
            <LI>XPAT 5.2.x cannot read indexes generated by 5.3.  That is, 5.3 is not forward-compatible.</LI>
            <LI>Because XPAT 5.2.x cannot read indexes generated by 5.3 and because DLXS sites may continue to use 5.2 for a period of time we've chosen to deliver 5.2 versions of the sample data indexes.  </LI>
            <LI>With respect to Unicode support for element names and attribute names and values, xmlrgn is limited to Unicode code points in the range from 0 to 127 decimal, i.e. to USASCII values.   multirgn should be used to create region indexes for XML where element names and/or attributes and attribute values are outside this range.

            <LI>Support for newly released ID Resolver.</LI>

              <LI>Member data keys changed to lower case</LI>
              <LI>CollsInfo.pm: Addition of access methods for "globalnamespace"
                so that code could be shared. Also changed passing
                of object creation parameters as a hash rather than
                as an array.</LI>
              <LI>DbUtils.pm:  routines were added to 
                to provide new basic functionality for storing and
                retrieving rows.</LI>
              <LI>LibGlobals.cfg: Updated configuration of idresolver. The $gIdResolver variable is
                now initially set to the value of the virtual host
                for the idresolver rather than the URL for the idresolver. </LI>              
              <LI>New module PIFiller.pm with subclasses PerlPIFiller.pm and XsltPIFiller.pm generalizing the filtering of XML for output.</LI>
              <LI>QueryFactory.pm: Changed 'and' to 'or in NaturalLanguageBaseQuery
                in the case where the search type is 'simple' and
                there are multiple q1's since the query is logically
                q1 + q1 + ... + q1 i.e. a disjunction not a conjunction. Change an '&amp;' character into '&amp;amp;' which is the form it must have in XML so user can
                search for e.g. "Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water" but protect
                actual entered character entity references like '&amp;eacute;'.</LI>

	  <UL><LI>MySQL is supported in addition to XPAT for searching collection metadata. XPAT will likely not be supported in future releases of Image Class.</LI>
	    <LI>JPEG2000 is supported in addition to MrSID. Behavior is identical. JPEG2000 command line compression/decompression utilities are provided.</LI>
	    <LI>Configuration of field abbreviations and labels, as well as the mapping of fields for cross-collection searching, is now done in Collmgr. 
	      Collectionmaps.pm and makeCollectionmaps-idx are no lnger used.</LI>
	    <LI>The form of field abbreviations has changed. "dots" are no longer allowed. SGML may continue to have dots, no need to redo data.
	      As field abbreviations are migrated to Collmgr they must have "dots" converted to underscores.</LI>
	    <LI>The Collmgr field "dfltsrchflds" now must include an abbreviation in the form "collid_all" to enable searching of the entire record. 
	      This field should be mapped to ic_all in the field_xcoll_maps Collmgr field for full record searching in across collections.</LI>
	    <LI>MySQL table structure for Portfolios has changed for increased data stability.</LI>
	    <LI>Media support has been improved. Practically any form of media (QuickTime, Flash, MP3) can be included in Image Class. Level of support varies. Configuration of imageprep has changed significantly.</LI>

		  <LI>Made a change to ImageApp so that portfolios
		    can find items that have old ID delims. Made a change
		    to Image Class Utils to support new and old delims
		    in nextpreventry.</LI>
		  <LI>Small changes to make portfolios work
		    properly with new as well as old isentryid delimiters.</LI>
		  <LI>Fixed a bug that had disabled adding
		    to or deleting from Bookbag/Portfolio. Also made retrieval
		    of existing BookBag items more robust in the sense
		    that it now is better about retrieving and deleting
		    items with ids that are in older forms.</LI>
		  <LI>Parameters passed to object creation
		    now a hash instead of an array.</LI>
		  <LI>Major changes were made in order to
		    add support for mySQL to image class. ImageApp methods
		    were shifted and/or partitioned in order to simplify
		    subclassing for mySQL. With this commit, both xpat
		    and mysql should be largely functional. XClass searching
		    needs to be tested. The changes for mySQL provided
		    an opportune time to stop the use of full region names
		    in rgn parameters and to stop using Collectionmaps.pm.
		    These changes are complete with the exception if needing
		    some validity checking of rgn parameters.</LI>
		  <LI>Changed all member data keys to lowercase
		    (ciowrapper, session, cgi, etc.)</LI>
		  <LI>made to be compatable with lib changes.
		    also fixed bug in portfolios where missing items were
		    not being displayed as "missing" they were simply
		    not being displayed. other changes included a fix
		    for the problem where xcoll field data would not display
		    (e.g., dlxs_ma) and other little things.</LI>
		  <LI>Changes were made to ImageApp.pm, ImageClassUtils.pm,
		    and imageclass.cfg to abandon the use of "storable"
		    freeze and thaw for the long-term storage of BookBag
		    items. The new mechanism stores BookBag items in a
		    seperate table, one per row. The freeze/thaw approach
		    was occassionally storing BookBags that could not
		    be thawed. The root of the problem was never discovered.
		    To faciliate this change and to migrate data from
		    the frozen storage to the new table, a script called
		    convertBookBag.pl has been created and can be found
		    in bin/i/image. It is important to read the comments

		  <LI>Greater support for media formats was

		  <LI>ImageApp.pm::forceAuth now checks,

		    to occur when a portfolio page has been bookmarked.
		    previously the behavior was to display the items the
		    user is authorized to use, but this could be confusing.</LI>
		  <LI>ImageApp.pm: support for TOTALRESULTS
		    PI was added to results handler. It simply inserts
		    the number of total results. The intended use is in
		    bbthumbfull.tpl (portfolios) to create a referenceable
		    javascript variable that knows the total number of
		    results. This addition allowed the PI THUMBFULLJSARRAYS
		    to be deprecated. Minor mods were also made to maintain
		    the results view when opening a new portfolio, etc.
		    ImageClassUtils.pm: Primarily, changes were made to
		    support new functionality in portfolio's "thumb with
		    full record" view. iFrames are now used to allow scrolling
		    of thumbs while keeping the full record in it's place.
		    This functionaly can also be used in the regular (non-porfolios)
		    "thumb with full record" view, though it has not yet
		    been applied. Care was taken to maintain backward
		    compatibility with existing templates. As of this
		    commit, however, it is most likely that NS Nav 4.x
		    has some disfunctioning portfolio functions. Namely,
		    check/uncheck all items. imageclass.cfg: Minor changes
		    were made to "help" text for thumbfull views. Also
		    minor changes to the global var gWindowProps, which
		    specifies how certain pop-up windows are to be created.</LI>
		  <LI>Minor changes to further advance support
		    for mysql. Added data_table field to collmgr. Changed
		    code to use data_table field. Changed nature of media_table

		    the name of the media_table. Code was updated to use
		    media_table in this new way.</LI>
		  <LI>Added support for 'SID' PI to all page
		    handlers. Dropped a related but unused subroutine
		    sidParam from ImageClassUtils.</LI>
		  <LI>Fixed a bug that caused portfolios
		    to fail to display items in all cases. Stemmed from
		    Lib change that added cio to the list of parameters
		    passed to BookBagItem for initialization. Also added
		    use of new mediahost colldb field, which allows the
		    server that delivers images to be specified per collection.

		  <LI>Major changes were made in order to

		  <LI>Changes were made to ImageApp.pm, ImageClassUtils.pm,

		    was occassionally storing BookBags that could not
		    be thawed. The root of the problem was never discovered.
		    To faciliate this change and to migrate data from
		    the frozen storage to the new table, a script called
		    convertBookBag.pl has been created and can be found

		    mysql as for image class content in image class. this

		  <LI>Minor changes to further advance support
		    for mysql. Added data_table field to collmgr. Changed
		    code to use data_table field. Changed nature of media_table
		    field. Instead of "yes"/"no" values, it now holds
		    the name of the media_table. Code was updated to use
		    media_table in this new way.</LI>
		  <LI>Changes were made related to the use
		    of mysql as a search engine for image class. A bug
		    in the area of related views was fixed. Query building
		    was improved (the query itself is more efficient when
		    run).</LI>
		  <LI>Add to Bookbag from entry view was
		    generating an assertion error for mysql collections.
		    Fixed two small things and it is fine.</LI>
		  <LI>getimage-idx was altered in order to
		    add mySQL support for metadata. Now it would work
		    with xpat, or mysql, and with our without a mysql
		    media_table. Part of this change included shifting
		    the mysqlSearchEngineInit subroutine from mysqlImageApp.pm
		    to ImageClassUtils.pm so that it can be also be used
		    by getimage-idx.</LI>
		  <LI>Added functionality to retrieve an
		    individual item by an old id that may have been bookmarked
		    or stored in a portfolio.</LI>
		  <LI>minor change</LI>
		  <LI>Added support for 'SID' PI to all page
		    handlers. Dropped a related but unused subroutine
		    sidParam from ImageClassUtils.</LI>
		  <LI>Added a global variable to act as a
		    switch for turning on and off mysql fulltext boolean
		    mode, which is only available in version 4.0.2 or
		    newer of MySQL.</LI>
		  <LI>Fixed a bug in the use of "Boolean"
		    mysql searching.</LI>
		  <LI>Clarified query building options for
		    mysql in code and in comments.</LI>
		  <LI>Minor mod to distinguish between an
		    undef and an empty media_table field.</LI>
		  <LI>Modified the tagDBdata subroutine to
		    handle the most basic image filename extensions (without
		    needing to have a media table). Specifically, deals
		    with the situation where the image filename field
		    contains a filename that includes a filename extension.
		    If extensions other than tif, tiff, jpg are encountered,
		    a media table is required. It is also OK not to have
		    a filename extension.</LI>
		  <LI>Minor change to getimage-idx to add
		    handling of tif, tiff, jpg extensions when there is
		    not a media_table.</LI>
		  <LI>Fixed bug that caused record and image
		    counts to fail with mysql colls.</LI>
		  <LI>Added phrase searching of a specified
		    field in order to enable accurate retrieval of IDs
		    that have non-alpha-numeric chars. The field can be
		    specfied in the field_admin_maps field of collmgr.</LI>
		  <LI>Fixed bug that caused assertion error
		    when the user does not use the first search box.</LI>

          explicitly set as tpl= for customization on the url
          or was derived from cgi parameters like page, view,
          or browse. In the explicit case the fallback is from
          collection to group but cannot proceed to class (because
          it's custom) whereas in the non-explicit case the
          fallback depends on the cross-collection mode i.e.
          on whether we're looking for collection, group or
          class templates.</LI>

                  <LI>Finally get fallback correct for tpl=
          parameter. The specified value of the tpl= parameter
          is a filename that falls back as a function of xcollmode
          (groups colls singlecollection) just like everything
          else</LI>
                  <LI>Enhanced fallback for ImageClass using
          a new mode "groupcoll" which supports fallback for
          the case of a single c= appearing with a g= The fallback
          is from coll to group to default group to class. Also
          support for "defaultgroupid" in Collection table when
          it is added to the database schema. This allows singlecoll
          mode 'to fallback form coll to default group to class,
          again for ImageClass and probably TextClass.</LI>

                  <LI>Fix case in GetDefaultFileForCGC()
          SPECIAL CASE: for resolving tpl=file.tpl (e.g. browse.tpl).
          file.tpl must be located in coll, default group
          or (unlikely) class space: if $xcollMode is 'colls'
          because xc=1 (meaning we came from the cross-collection
          interface) but there is only once 'c' (user is navigating
          within a single collection) we need to make it look
          like we're in single collection mode for the purposes
          of resolution in this routine.</LI>
                  <LI>Added $gIdResolver to LibGlobals so

<UL>
                <LI>TextClass has undergone significant re-architecture in order to implement sorting of results by author, title or date and, in cross-collection searches, to inter-file results from all selected collections.  </LI>
                <LI>The results list is now more consistent across encoding levels.  The initial results list consists of a bibliographic display per item.  </LI>
                <LI>The user may select a link on the to see detailed search results either as summaries of hits or as key-word-in-context (KWIC).  </LI>
                <LI>Full support for collection groups is now available via a "group select page" allowing the user to narrow their attention to search a group of related collections.  </LI>
                <LI>The cross-collection search page now displays the group (if any) within which the collections to be searched reside, along with the other available groups.</LI>
                <LI>TextClass default templates have been modularized so that, for example, the search page template is a single file supporting all of the search types via "chunks" of html that can be plugged into the master template. The navbar is also a module.  In general, this modularization should reduce the number of files that require modification to effect a site-wide change. </LI></UL></LI>

                <LI> Pages can be associated with contone "figures" that appear in them. 
When displaying the bitonal page, thumbnails of included figures, if 
any, are displayed. Each thumbnail has a link built to ImageClass to 
display a larger image, with all associated ImageClass behavior 
(panning, zooming, etc.)</LI>
                <LI>There is a new table in the dlxs database called PageviewFig to hold 
information about any figure images, and there is a new field in the 
Pageview table to hold information about the bit depth of a page image 
(related to whether it is bitonal, contone, etc.)</LI>

                  <LI>Added debugging. Fixed sorting for
            the case where there are missing dates or authors.
            We have to do 2 queries: one for the dates and one
            for the titles in headers without dates and merge
            the results in an rset. Cant be done in one query
            because there are 2 regions (date and title) but the
            pr.region.... command only lets us spec one of them.
            The same for author too. Removed ALLSELECTED from
            the CGI object before constructing the cache key --
            ALLSELECTED is analogous to the cc -- it should not
            appear.</LI>

                  <LI>Fixed up a couple of link building

          c (that does have a word wheel index), no link to
          wordwheel will be built if there is a "xc" parameter.</LI>
                  <LI>In the building of a "word index" link

          routine.</LI>
                  <LI>Changes to building of home link to

                  <LI>Added xg parameter to links on groups

          the left frame (with aforementioned links) continues
          to be built.</LI>
                  <LI>Added logic to force intersection of
          values in region pulldown in search forms to 'full
          text' for simple and proximity and 'works' for other
          search types. Javascript in search.js will need to
          have the same logic (although it intersects values
          from the arrays built from the CGI grabbing colldb
          values).</LI>

                  <LI>Fix HIDDEN_VARS PI for bbagemail.tpl

                  <LI>
Significant changes were made to certain processing instructions. There is backward compatibility, however use of the PATH PI and the corresponding ImageClassUtils::pathByType subroutine is deprecated. A combination of the following PIs is now preferred: FBFILE (builds a link to a file in the web space using standard fallback mechanisms to determine the path), JAVASCRIPTURL, and CGIROOT.  Class level stylesheet files are now hardcoded paths relative to the web server docroot. Previously the paths were generated with a PI and fallback, which isn't actually appropriate since the class level style sheet file is always linked as a default. Also, an instance of the INSERTTEXT PI was added to the entry.tpl file. It is configured to insert into the template the contents of a file called "entryinfo.tpl". This is to facilitate the display of collection specific information in the entry template, such as a blanket copyright statement. 
            </LI>
                  
                  <LI>
The "onload" statement was removed from the BODY tag. It contained a javascript preload command that was attempting to load image files that do not exist and are not necessary. It also caused a lot of unnecessary server error log entries. The onload statement should be removed from all copies of the entry.tpl template.
            </LI>
                  
                  
                  <LI>
Templates were modified to fix a problem Netscape 4x had with the way the style sheets were being loaded.
             </LI>
                  
                  <LI>
entry.tpl was modified to move the header into each div. this allows the current div view (full image, description, etc. ) to be "sticky" while navigating to next/prev entries. it also allows other aspects of the view to be "sticky", for example the image size viewed. other things are intentionally not "sticky", such as the zoom state. 
             </LI>
                  
                  <LI>
Minor aesthetic changes were made to the slice summary and fisheye. The extra bold tags were removed from around the summary/fisheye at the bottom of the results pages. The css now takes care of making the text bold. Also, a fisheye style was added in order to facilitate customization of the fisheye.
             </LI>
                  <LI>
reslist, thumbfull, and thumbnail templates were modified simply to set the alignment of the middle column of header 1 to "center". This should keep the "new search" link from colliding with the banner text as it has been.

                function "MM_showHideLayers" was rewritten to support

                unused javascript functions were removed completely.

              <LI>Image Class was checked for compatability
                with SGML that does and does not have new lines. Previously
                the middleware expected the SGML to have all newlines
                removed. Now it will work either way. One benefit
                of this is a reduction of storage space needed for
                prep files.</LI>
              
              <LI>The Image Class dependency on the group
                "all" has been removed. It is no longer necessary
                to have a group "all" and it is fine for a collection
                to not be any group whatsoever.</LI>
              
              <LI>Image Class now uses Lib fallback routines
                for choosing templates, graphics, css, javascript
                files. This, along with similar work done to Text
                Class and Bib Class brings consistency to the way
                the classes handle fallback. It also introduces fallback
                from the group to the class level, which is a significant
                and good change for Image Class. There is also support
                now for default groups to be specified per collection
                in the collection database (though at this moment
                the new field has not been added to the collection
                database.) Standardization of fallback led to global
                variable house cleaning in Image Class. ImageClassUtils::setupPaths
                has been eliminated, taking with it the globals hashes
                previously used for holding essential paths and urls.
                A few other global variables were consolidated or
                simply dropped if not needed.</LI>
              
              <LI>Features for turning a field in to
                a linked URL were added to ICLocalUtils::insertField.
                New PI parameters "baseurl" and "urltext" are now
                accepted.</LI>
              
              <LI>The Image Class index.tpl page can
                now have a search form on it, using relevant PIs,
                if desired.</LI>
              
              <LI>Image Class had been calling ciofactory
                twice in order to make sure that collids for items
                in a bookbag/portfolio were properly resolved and
                marked as requested. It accounted for the fact that
                sometimes bookbag items were coming from a collection
                that hadn't yet been requested/selected for searching.
                As it turns out, calling ciofactory a second time
                wasn't necessary. It works fine to just remove all
                c parameters from the cgi object, which is the same
                as requesting all collections. To make a long story
                short, the code that Image Class used to cull collids
                out of bookbag item ids and to call ciofactory a second
                time has been removed with no apparent side affects.</LI>
              
              <LI>A bug was fixed in ImageApp.pm where
                the string sId-placeholder was failing to get converted
                to sId-actualsessionid. This caused Portfolios to
                not work properly in the session-based model.</LI>
              
              <LI>An "addPI" command was strategically
                placed in ImageApp.pm so that the bbdel.tpl loads
                cascading style sheets properly. A global switch was
                added to Image Class to turn on and off PUBLIC portfolio
                functionality specifically. It is configurable in
                imageclass.cfg.</LI>
              
              <LI>

              <LI> Sorting of results
                was changed so that the default/unsorted order
                is data occurrence order.Results had been getting
                sorted by ID if nothing else. Sorting is now a wee
                bit faster as well. </LI>
              <LI>
Next/Prev entry navigation in
                the book bag had to be removed do to data retrieveal
                and sorting complications. It didn't work right before,
                so this is not a great loss.</LI>
              
              <LI>A global sort threshhold was added to Image Class.</LI>
              
              <LI>Changes were made to support "sticky"
                entry views while navigating using next/prev. </LI>
              
              <LI>Another minor change was made so that a message
                is left and an assertion error avoided if a portfolio
                item is not found.</LI>
              
              <LI>ImageClassUtils::entryDivDisplayButtons
                was changed to suppress display of the "view buttons"
                (for switching between "full image", "description",
                and "other views") in the situation where there is
                only 1 view configured for the collection in CollMgr.</LI>
              
              <LI>ImageClassUtils.pm was changed to support
                use of relative rather than absolute image file references
                in the img/index directory. ImageClassUtils.pm is
                backward compatible with previously created index

These will appear between the fisheye and "&lt;&lt; previous items" and between the fisheye and "next items &gt;&gt;" on the TOP and BOTTOM of the results pages. Therefore customized templates, including collection specific templates, should have the vertical bars around the fisheye PI removed. This solves the problem of bars being displayed even when there are not enough results to warrant a fisheye. The few remaining chunks of "interface english" left in the code were shifted to the %gWords has h in imageclass.cfg. This change affected ImageClassUtils.pm as well.</LI>

                <LI> Added DLXSDATAROOT functionality</LI>
                <LI> A change was made to hide the panning tool when panning is not an option (e.g., when the full image is being viewed).</LI>
                <LI> Added Get[CG]ioByClass() for cross class access to CIO and GIO from DSO. Alos added 'ApplicationClass' attribute for CioFactory->new() calls to identify Class for CIO/GIO operations.</LI>
                <LI> Additional field display options were added to the RecordFilt subroutine. A field may have multiple urls (separated by whitespace) in it, and all will be turned in to links if the "url" option is on. "urltarget" (allows target to be specified when "url" option is on).</LI>
                <LI> "urltarget," "delim," and "keylinks," field display options were added to RecordFilt. the "url" option was modified to support multiple urls in a single field.</LI>
                <LI> Collection Home links were added to collection picking routines.</LI>
                <LI> Fixed minor bug that stopped group "all" from being excluded from the group selection list when the pi specifies it. the "next" was inside the debug scope.</LI>
                <LI> A validity check was added for the rgnN parameter to make sure that for each qN parameter, there is an rgnN parameter. When there is not, term highlighting does not work properly.</LI>
                <LI> A small HTML error was corrected in the RecordFilt subroutine, shifting a "nowrap" attribute from the TR to TD tag in two places.</LI>

      <H1>DLXS Release 8 - 22 Mar 2002</H1>
      <DIV2>
        <H2>General Information</H2>
        <P>This is an interim release of DLXS middleware. </P>
        <P>DLXS Release 8 is comprised of TextClass version 2.5.0, BibClass version
  2.1.6, FindingAids version 2.0.3, ImageClass version 2.3.1, Broker version 1.1.2, Collmgr version 1.1.0, mrsid_retrieve version 1.3.1, tif2web version 1.0.0, dlxsd version 1.0.0 and XPAT version 5.2.3. In particular, dlxsd (the remote daemon), mrsid_retrieve and tif2web are first-time deliverables in this release. </P>
        <P>Release 8 introduces a new architecture incorporating an Application Object which
encapsulates the mainline code from a given class of middleware (text-idx, image-idx, bib-idx) and abstracts it into a Perl class that can be instantiated and manipulated as an object.  The main program is reduced to just a few lines.  The Application Object's class can be subclassed to change functionality in a manner similar to the subclasses of the TextClass collection object base class. In addition, a single CGI program can instantiate multiple application objects (from different middleware classes) and combine their functionality to produce "cross-class" applications.  We expect to demonstrate such functionality in an upcoming release.</P>
        <P>Release 8 has a new top-level directory structure  "misc/{db,c/class/maps}" that replaces obj/c/class/lib/{db,maps}. </P>

                was necessary, the cgi ended up redirecting to itself
                rather than to the login screen. This resulted in
                an endless loop that timed out before too long.

            <LI>Corrected bug where image would fail to display if session was new. It worked when using an old session because the group parameter would get picked up from the session.</LI>
            <LI>If mrsid_retrieve is not found, Sidget2 module now reports this as a debug message. It does not bail, because there are some situations where it is OK that mrsid_retrieve is not available. getimage-idx now uses group "all" if it is not a cross collection search. This corrects a problem where an inappropropriate group was being used when a collection specific search was initiated from a non-all group selection page.</LI>
            <LI>Corrected the problem where the cross collection search form was not displaying a collection's searchable fields in the case where a single collection was selected and the dfltsrchflds collmgr entry was "default".</LI>
            <LI>Links to getthumbnail-idx were getting built without a session id. This is now corrected.</LI>
            <LI>Fixed problem where fallback was not working for "viewtabs" graphics in the sense that the middleware was not checking for the presense of collection specific files.</LI>
            <LI>Corrected a problem where bbentry.tpl and entry.tpl templates lacked quote marks around an attribute value for a PI. In bbentry, this caused the graphics for panning and zooming to not display properly.</LI>

          <UL>
            <LI>Image Class does not work properly when using MySQL for the session database. CSV is therefore preferred. Since the session database is configured in Lib (i.e., globally for all of DLXS), CSV must be used for all Classes if Image Class is to be used. The installer will ask, "Select the session datastore type," which should be answered "CSV" if Image Class is to be used. The configuration can be changed post-install by editing the value of $gSessDatabaseSelector in /DLXSROOT/lib/DlpsSession.cfg.</LI>
            <LI>The Makefiles for building Image Class XPAT indexes allocate 384 MB to
the xpatbld process. If the memory allocation fails, the allocation
should be lowered using the following guideline:
Memory allocation for xpatbld (-m 384m) should be no more than 3/4
physical memory. And, there is no need for it to be more than twice
thesize of the .sgm file.

                  <LI>Significant changes to how notes and their scoping parents are searched for and filtered.   There are now 2 mechanisms to define <CODE>NOTEPARENT</CODE> regions: (1) as usual in the <CODE>coll.extra.srch</CODE> as a fabricated region and (2) explicitly in the subclass code (if the parent regions may be nested). </LI>

                  <LI>Added filtering to <CODE>TextFilter</CODE> to map &lt;S> (textclass.dtd sentence element, html strikethru) to nothing.   Added similar filtering to <CODE>CleanResidualTags</CODE> for KWIC handling.</LI>

                  <LI>Added <CODE>GetNoteMaxDivHead</CODE> to indicate the deepest level at which NOTE1 or PTR might occur. Needed to know where to start looking for parent DIV (HEAD).

One, as a result of a generalization in the database connect mechanism, is trivial because the class middleware interface to DbUtils.pm is mediated by the CollsInfo.pm and GroupsInfo.pm APIs this change should have no effect on existing middleware.</P>

            <LI>Several bugs that caused XPAT sessions to run endlessly were
				  eliminated. </LI>
            <LI>Improved display in situations where thumbnails are not
				  available, especially for related views.</LI>
            <LI>Improved interface for navigating to related views from a
				  detail view. </LI>
            <LI>The transformation process can now find image filenames in any

          <H3>Backward Compatibility</H3>
          <P>DLXS  #5 introduces 2 non-backward compatible changes as a
				result of the move to the Perl DBI database interface and the update of
				Apache::Session to version 1.53 with its correspondingly different file
				structure for session management</P>
          <UL>
            <LI>The TextClass and BibClass configuration variable $gCollDbName
				  now points to the directory
				  <I>containing</I> the database tables rather than to the database
				  file (
				  <TT>colldb</TT>) itself. Because colldb is a DBI CSV table it can
				  contain neither blank lines nor comment (#) lines. The "s_" and "a_" data type
				  prefixes on the column heads have been eliminated also. To convert your colldb,
				  remove blank and comment lines and the "s_" and "a_" prefixes form the column
				  heads.</LI>
            <LI>The new session file structure now consists of a subdirectory
				  (e.g.
				  <TT>/tmp/sessions</TT> ) containing one file per session rather
				  than consisting of a single file maintaining all sessions. This change was
				  necessary due to problems with slow access to the CGI attributable to
				  contention for access to the single semaphore-protected file mechanism. In the
				  release, remove the session file and create a directory to hold the multiple
				  session files and a second directory (e.g.
				  <TT>/tmp/sessionslock</TT>) to hold the lock files which protect
				  the session files.</LI>
