<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>dbbuild</B> builds all the necessary files for the database specified
by <I>data_dictionary</I>.  A <I>data_dictionary</I> must be prepared before using <B>dbbuild</B>, as well as a template file
for any user meta-data (see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+mfsbld">mfsbld</A></B>(1)).  Refer
to the <I>Database Administration Guide</I> for further details.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-ver</B><DD>
version - display version number.  This option identifies the version number of the 
program and then exits.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
verbose - specify verbose mode.  This option tells <B>dbbuild</B> to turn on the verbose
mode of all the index-building programs it runs.  With verbose mode turned
on, these programs print progress messages as they proceed.
By default, <B>dbbuild</B> works quietly, only printing a minimum of messages.
<DT><B>-no_run</B><DD>
do not run- specify that <B>dbbuild</B> should not run the index builders.  This option 
tells <B>dbbuild</B> to display the
commands that it would issue to build the database.  This allows the user to
redirect the output from <B>dbbuild</B> to a file, which could then be executed as a shell
script. In this mode, the commands themselves are not executed.
<DT><B>-l</B> <I>log_file</I><DD>
log - specify the log file.  This option tells <B>dbbuild</B>
to send all the progress information that is produced by
the programs that it runs to the specified <I>log_file</I>.  This option
is very useful for recording the details of the build process in long
build operations or in helping to diagnose any build problems that might
occur.  This option can be used in
combination with the <B>-v</B> option, in which case the
diagnostic output is sent to both the screen and the log file.
<DT><B>-no_ff</B><DD>
no Fast Find indices - eliminates the building of Fast Find indices.  Open
Text strongly recommends the building of Fast Find indices, especially for MFS
databases.  Fast Find indices are built by default.
<DT><B>-no_opt</B><DD>
no optimization - turn optimization off.  When building MFS databases, <B>dbbuild</B> 
uses an optimization method by default.  This optimization
involves generating the virtual text of the entire MFS database
and writing it out to a temporary file on disk at the same time as it builds
the FileMap.
<B>dbbuild</B> then runs all the index-building programs on that text file.
It deletes the text file when all the necessary files have been built.
This temporary text file is usually considerably smaller than the total
size of all the word processor files combined, especially
in databases which consist mainly of word processor files.
This is because a significant amount of space is used in
each file for word processor formatting commands and related overhead.
<DT>&nbsp;<DD>
In some situations, the disk space required for this file is simply
not available.  In these cases, the <B>-no_opt</B> option may be
specified to allow <B>dbbuild</B> to proceed with the database build, at a
somewhat slower speed.
<DT><B>-merge</B><DD>
region merging - make <B>multirgn</B> and <B>sgmlrgn</B> to merge the new regions into the existing
regions. If the regions with the same name happens in different region building
phase, the later set of regions will completely replace the old region set.
This option allows the regions with the same name to be merged into the same
region set without replacement.
<DT><B>-dos</B><DD>
dos processing option - make <B>sgmlrgn</B> processing aware of special MS-DOS characters.
With this option, <B>sgmlrgn</B> will replace the special MS-DOS characters to blank
in order to avoid error during parsing.
<DT><B>-m</B> <I>N</I><B>k</B><DD>
<DT><B>-m</B> <I>N</I><B>m</B><DD>
memory - use <I>N</I> <B>k</B>ilobytes or <I>N</I>
<B>m</B>egabytes of physical memory during the database building process.
The speed with which the various index building programs operate
is affected by the amount of physical memory available.  By
default, <B>dbbuild</B> allocates 512 KB of memory for the index building programs it
runs.  While this is adequate for very small databases, larger databases
benefit by allocating more physical memory.  The <B>-m</B> option specifies
how much memory
programs can use.  A number immediately followed by the letter <B>k</B>
specifies that number of kilobytes.  A number immediately followed by
the letter <B>m</B> specifies that number of megabytes.  For instance,
`-m 4m' allocates 4 megabytes of memory for use by programs invoked by
<B>dbbuild</B>.  For large databases (where the text is broken into more than 10 chunks
by <B>xpatbld</B>), the amount of memory that is specified is critical to the efficiency
of the build operation.  Refer to the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+xpatbld">xpatbld</A></B>(1) man page and the section on <B>xpatbld</B>
parameters in the <I>Database Administration Guide</I> for the details on how to specify this memory parameter.
<DT><B>-o</B> <I>output_prefix</I><DD>
output filename prefix - specify the prefix to use for output files.
This option explicitly specifies the output filename prefix
for the files produced by the indexing programs.  The
default prefix is the prefix of the <I>data_dictionary</I>.

<DT><B>-w</B> <I>word_wheel</I><DD>

word wheel - specify that <B>dbbuild</B> is to build a word wheel file.
<B>dbbuild</B> will build this file using any regions prefixed with a
``*'' character in the <I>regions_list_file</I>.  See the <I>Database Administration Guide</I> for
an explanation of the word wheel.
<DT><B>-wwdb<DD>

word wheel - specify that <B>dbbuild</B> is to build a XPAT database on the
word wheel file specified with the
-w</B> <I>word_wheel</I> option.
<B>dbbuild</B> will also build
region indices in the word wheel database for any regions prefixed with a
``*'' character in the <I>regions_list_file</I>.  See the <I>Database Administration Guide</I> for
an explanation of the word wheel.

<DT><B>-f</B> <I>Fast_Region_file</I><DD>
Fast-Region list file -
specify that <B>dbbuild</B> is to build Fast-Region indices over the regions listed in
the <I>Fast_Region_file</I>.  The file should contain one region
name per line.

If a region name is prefixed with a &quot;*&quot;
character, <B>dbbuild</B> will build regions indices for the corresponding region in the
word wheel database (see the <B>-w</B> option).

See the <I>Database Administration Guide</I> for an explanation
of Fast-Regions.
<DT><B>-t</B> <I>tag_file</I><DD>
tag names file -
specify that <B>dbbuild</B> is to build region indices over the tags in the database
listed in the <I>tag_file</I> file.
This file is passed directly to <B>multirgn</B>.
The tag names file is only used with consolidated databases. 
Refer to the sections on building Release 5.0
databases in the <I>Database Administration Guide</I> and the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+multirgn">multirgn</A></B>(1) man page for more information
on the <I>tag_file</I> file.
<BR>

The -t, -inp and -c options are mutually exclusive.  The -t and -inp files are
used with consolidated databases.  The -c option is used with MFS databases.
<DT><B>-inp</B> <I>inp_file</I><DD>
inp file -
specify that <B>dbbuild</B> is to build region indices over the database using the <B>sgmlrgn</B>
program in region mode.
Refer to the sections on building Release 5.0
databases in the <I>Database Administration Guide</I> and the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+sgmlrgn">sgmlrgn</A></B>(1) man page for more information on
the <I>inp_file</I> file.
<BR>

The -t, -inp and -c options are mutually exclusive.  The -t and -inp files are
used with consolidated databases.  The -c option is used with MFS databases.
<DT><B>-c</B> <I>regions_config_file</I><DD>
regions configuration file -
specify that <B>dbbuild</B> is to build region indices over the sections of the MFS
database specified in the regions_config_file.  The regions configuration file
is only used with MFS databases.
The regions configuration file can consist of a mixture two types of regions
specifications: <B>multirgn</B> and <B>sgmlrgn</B>.  <B>multirgn</B> regions specifications consist of the
following tags:
<BR>


&lt;Regions&gt;&lt;DisplayFmt&gt;&lt;/DisplayFmt&gt;&lt;TagFile&gt;&lt;/TagFile&gt;&lt;/Regions&gt;

<BR>

Each such specification instructs <B>dbbuild</B> to invoke <B>multirgn</B> to build region indices
over the files referenced in the Data Dictionary by the DisplayFmt using TagFile specified.
See the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+multirgn">multirgn</A></B>(1) man page for further details.
<BR>

<B>sgmlrgn</B> regions specifications consist of the following tags:
<BR>


&lt;Regions&gt;&lt;GroupName&gt;&lt;/GroupName&gt;&lt;INPFile&gt;&lt;/INPFile&gt;&lt;/Regions&gt;

<BR>

Each such specification instructs <B>dbbuild</B> to invoke <B>sgmlrgn</B> to build region indices
over the files references in the Data Dictionary by the GroupName, using the <B>.inp</B>
file specified.  See the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+sgmlrgn">sgmlrgn</A></B>(1) man page for further details.
<BR>

The -t, -inp and -c options are mutually exclusive.  The -t and -inp files are
used with consolidated databases.  The -c option is used with MFS databases.
<DT><B>-O</B> <I>optimize_file</I><DD>
optimize file - specify the name and location of the MFS optimization file.
This is useful if there is not enough space on the current disk to hold both
the database and the optimization file.
If both <B>-no_opt</B> and <B>-O</B> options are specified on the command line,
<B>dbbuild</B> will take the last specification as the correct specification.
<DT><B>-tmp</B> <I>temp_file</I><DD>
temporary filename prefix - specify the file name prefix and location of
the <B>xpatbld</B> and
<B>xpatffi</B> temporary files.  This is useful if the current disk does not have enough
space to hold both the database and the temporary files.
<DT><B>-r</B> <I>phase_count</I><DD>
restart - specify that <B>dbbuild</B> is to restart from the last successful build
phase and continue for another <I>phase_count</I> phases.  This is useful for
stepping through each of the phases of <B>dbbuild</B>.  If more phases are specified then
remain in the database build, <B>dbbuild</B> continues until it has finished.  If the 
<B>-r</B> option is specified for a <B>dbbuild</B> that was never started, <B>dbbuild</B> starts from
the beginning of the database building process.  The phase information is
stored in the file called <B>restart.ot</B> in the local directory.
<DT><B>-u</B> <I>user_tags_file</I><DD>
tags file for user meta data - specify that <B>dbbuild</B> should use the 
<I>user_tags_file</I> to build regions within the user meta data.  The format of
the <I>user_tags_file</I> is as for the <B>-t</B> option.  The <B>-u</B> option
is used with MFS databases.
</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

<P>

A typical consolidated database building session is invoked with the following
parameters:  
<P>


<PRE>
  dbbuild -v -l logfile -m 28m -o db -D db.dd
</PRE>


<P>

This example specifies that messages generated during the building
process should be echoed to the screen (-v) and to the log file
called logfile (-l logfile).  28 megabytes of memory
are allocated to <B>dbbuild</B> (-m 28m) and the index
files are all named with the prefix `db' (-o db).  The Data
Dictionary is called `db.dd' (-D db.dd).
<P>
Should the user stop the build process before it completes, the following will
restart <B>dbbuild</B> after the last successful build phase and will stop after the next
two phases are complete:
<P>


<PRE>
  dbbuild -r 2
</PRE>


<P>

A typical MFS database building session is invoked with the following
parameters:  
<P>


<PRE>
  dbbuild -v -l logfile -m 28m -o db -c db.cfg -D db.dd
</PRE>


<P>

All the parameters for this build operation are the same as for the
consolidated database example, except that db.dd is an MFS
Data Dictionary and there is a regions configuration file (db.cfg).
<BR>

For this example, assume the Data Dictionary had the following FilterChain
specifications:
<P>


<PRE>
      &lt;FilterChain&gt;
        &lt;SearchView&gt;meta&lt;/SearchView&gt;
        &lt;DisplayView&gt;meta&lt;/DisplayView&gt;
        &lt;RawView&gt;meta&lt;/RawView&gt;
        &lt;DisplayFmt&gt;wp&lt;/DisplayFmt&gt;
        &lt;FileGroup&gt;
          &lt;MfsDir&gt;wp&lt;/MfsDir&gt;
          &lt;MfsFile&gt;wp*&lt;/MfsFile&gt;
          &lt;MfsExpand&gt;tree&lt;/MfsExpand&gt;
        &lt;/FileGroup&gt;
      &lt;/FilterChain&gt;
      &lt;FilterChain&gt;
        &lt;SearchView&gt;meta&lt;/SearchView&gt;
        &lt;DisplayView&gt;meta&lt;/DisplayView&gt;
        &lt;RawView&gt;meta&lt;/RawView&gt;
        &lt;DisplayFmt&gt;bus&lt;/DisplayFmt&gt;
        &lt;FileGroup&gt;
          &lt;MfsDir&gt;bus&lt;/MfsDir&gt;
          &lt;MfsFile&gt;bus.txt&lt;/MfsFile&gt;
          &lt;MfsExpand&gt;file&lt;/MfsExpand&gt;
        &lt;/FileGroup&gt;
      &lt;/FilterChain&gt;
      &lt;FilterChain&gt;
        &lt;SearchView&gt;meta&lt;/SearchView&gt;
        &lt;DisplayView&gt;meta&lt;/DisplayView&gt;
        &lt;RawView&gt;meta&lt;/RawView&gt;
        &lt;DisplayFmt&gt;sgml,simple&lt;/DisplayFmt&gt;
        &lt;FileGroup&gt;
          &lt;MfsDir&gt;simple&lt;/MfsDir&gt;
          &lt;MfsFile&gt;simple.sgm&lt;/MfsFile&gt;
          &lt;MfsExpand&gt;file&lt;/MfsExpand&gt;
        &lt;/FileGroup&gt;
      &lt;/FilterChain&gt;
</PRE>


<P>

This Data Dictionary specifies three FilterChains which we will characterize by
their DisplayFmts.  The first FilterChain consists of a directory of word
processor files, which have no structure tags.  The second FilterChain consists
of a file called bus, which is a tagged text file suitable for <B>multirgn</B> to
build region indices over.  The third FilterChain consists of an SGML file,
which is suitable for <B>sgmlrgn</B> to build region indices over.
<BR>

The following is an appropriate regions configuration file (db.cfg) for
the above Data Dictionary:
<P>


<PRE>
&lt;Regions&gt;&lt;DisplayFmt&gt;bus&lt;/DisplayFmt&gt;&lt;TagFile&gt;bus/bus.tag&lt;/TagFile&gt;&lt;/Regions&gt;
&lt;Regions&gt;&lt;GroupName&gt;simple&lt;/GroupName&gt;&lt;INPFile&gt;simple/simple.inp&lt;/INPFile&gt;&lt;/Regions&gt;
</PRE>


<P>

When <B>dbbuild</B> is run with this regions configuration file, <B>multirgn</B> will be run over the
files specified by the bus DisplayFmt using the bus/bus.tag
tag names file.  <B>sgmlrgn</B> will be run over the files specified by the
sgml,simple DisplayFmt using the <B>.inp</B> called
simple/simple.inp.
<BR>

Note that no region indices will be built over the word processor files
specified by the wp DisplayFmt.
<BR>

Again, the user can also use the restart option.
<P>


<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DETAILED OPERATION</H2>


The <B>dbbuild</B> program works by invoking each of the necessary database
building tools in the correct sequence.  The following paragraphs
describe how each of these tools works.
<P>


The first phase in building an MFS database is to generate the
FileMap.  The FileMap is generated by the <B>mfsbld</B> program.  This program
reads the MFS fields in the Data Dictionary and generates the three 
FileMap files.  Refer to the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+mfsbld">mfsbld</A></B>(1) man page for further details.
This phase is skipped for regular databases.
<P>


Once <B>mfsbld</B> has finished building the FileMap, <B>dbbuild</B> calls the
<B>xpatbld</B> program to build the Main Index.  Refer to the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+xpatbld">xpatbld</A></B>(1) man
page for further details on this process.
<P>


The next phase builds the Fast-Find Index.  This index is built
using the <B>xpatffi</B> and <B>xpatffw</B> programs.  Refer to the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+xpatffi">xpatffi</A></B>(1) and <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+xpatffw">xpatffw</A></B>(1)
man pages for further details on the Fast-Find indices and their build programs.
<P>


The final phase involves building the region indices using the <B>multirgn</B> program.
Note that <B>dbbuild</B> passes
the name of the <I>tag_names</I> file directly to <B>multirgn</B>.  Refer to
the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+multirgn">multirgn</A></B>(1) man page for further details about this program.
<P>


Once the region building process has completed, <B>dbbuild</B> removes any
temporary files and then exits.  The database is then ready to be
searched with <B>xpat</B>.
