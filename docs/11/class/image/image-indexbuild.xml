<BHEAD>Image Class XPAT Index Building</BHEAD> <DIV1 ID="main"> 
<P><A HREF="mailto:dlxs-help@umich.edu">dlxs-help@umich.edu</A> </P>

<P>This document describes the steps necessary to build an XPAT index for the 
  Image Class. </P>
<P><B>New in Version 2:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>It is now recomended that an individual XPAT index 
  be built for each collection rather than a single XPAT index for all. Image 
  Class version 2 still supports the use of a multiple collection index, with 
  the caveat that a collid cannot be a substring of any other collid. e.g., collids 
  &quot;bhl&quot; and &quot;bhlpoetry&quot; cannot be part of the same XPAT index. 
  The bug is in the middleware, not XPAT or the index. The symptom is that a search 
  within the collection with the shorter collid will also search the collection 
  with the longer collid. </LI>
<LI>The make file command for building an XPAT index has been 
  changed to &quot;make all&quot;.</LI>
<LI>multiregion is used instead of sgmlregion.</LI>
</UL>
<DIV2 ID="image-blank"> 
<H2>About image-blank</H2>
<P>Distributed with Image Class is a preconfigured XPAT index directory named 
  "image-blank" that can be used as a boilerplate for building new Image Class 
  XPAT indexes. You find image-blank at...</P>
<PRE>$DLXSROOT/idx/i/image-blank</PRE>
</DIV2> <DIV2 ID="setup"> 

<H2>Setup New Collection Specific Directories (if necessary)</H2>
<P>In DLXS all content data (sgml for Image Class) are stored under $DLXSROOT/obj 
  with the exception of continuous tone images which are stored under $DLXSROOT/img. 
  It is necessary to create collection specific obj and idx directories for each 
  collection.</P>

<P>Starting with DLXS CD #8, a shell script ($DLXSROOT/bin/i/image/setupcollindex) was included that automatically creates and configures idx and obj directories for a new collection. It also copies the sgml file from $DLXSROOT/prep/c/collid to $DLXSROOT/obj/c/collid. It stops short of actually building the index.</P>

<P>usage: $DLXSROOT/bin/i/image/setupcollindex c/collid</P>

<P>example: $DLXSROOT/bin/i/image/setupcollindex s/sampleic</P>

<UL>
  <LI>All SGML files must have the filename extension .sgm</LI>
  <LI>All SGML files must already be normalized and validated against the Image Class SGML DTD. (If the prescribed database transformation steps were followed, 
    this is taken care of.)</LI>
  <LI>All SGML file permissions should be 664.</LI>
</UL>
</DIV2> <DIV2 ID="build"> 
<H2>Build the XPAT Index</H2>
<P>With all of the SGML files properly placed in the $DLXSROOT/obj/c/collid directory, 
  and the $DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid directory setup, the XPAT index can be built. Most 
  collections of several thousand records will build in less than an hour. Large 
  collections could take several hours. It depends on the amount of data and the 
  available computing power. Building an index with a small amount of data is 
  recommended on the first try. A few hundred records is appropriate for starters, 
  and will only take a few minutes to run.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Navigate to the /11/idx/c/collid directory</LI>
  <LI>Issue the comand <B>make all </B>(previously make dd)</LI>
  <LI>Wait until it says it is done</LI>
</OL>
<P><B>Tip: </B>If you want the index to build in the background and without needing 
  to worry about the process dying if the session is lost, try... <TT>nohup make 
  all &amp;</TT></P>
</DIV2> <DIV2 ID="link"> 
<H2>Test the Index</H2>
<P>It is possible to test the index by starting an XPAT session on the command 
  line from within <TT>$DLXSROO/idx/c/collid</TT>.</P>

<H2>Moving an Index to a Different Machine and Into Service</H2>
<P>It is possible and favorable to move a built index to a new location. For example, 
  at Michigan, an XPAT index is built on a development machine and then moved 
  to a production machine. Building an index is an intensive CPU process that 
  can take a few minutes to several hours. Building an XPAT index on the development 
  machine removes the burden from the production machine. It also allows an index 
  to be tested thoroughly in the development environment before being moved to 
  production. </P>
<P>The steps for moving an index and associated SGML files from one machine to 
  another, and into production are:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Create a tar file of the $DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid directory (<TT>cd $DLXSROOT/idx/c;
tar cf idxcollid.tar ./collid</TT>)</LI>
  <LI>Create a tar file of the $DLXSROOT/obj/c/collid directory</LI>
  <LI>Transfer the tar files to the destination machine.</LI>
  <LI>Remove any existing $DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid and $DLXSROOT/c/collid directories 
    from the destination.</LI>
  <LI>Extract the files from the tar files.</LI>
</OL>
<P>It is important to know that since paths are hard-coded in the index, the index 
  must be put into an identical directory location at the destination; otherwise 
  it will not work.</P>
</DIV2><DIV2 id="useful"> 
<H2>Other Ideas</H2>
<P>It might be useful to manage multiple instances of idx and obj directories 
  for a single collection and then use a symlink to point to the index that is 
  to be used by the middleware. For example, one could have $DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid-a 
  and $DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid-b plus a symlink $DLXSROOT/idx/c/collid that points to 
  the a or b instance. This approach might simplify the deployment of collection 
  updates with minimal disruption of service.</P>
<P>A better approach is to build indexes in a development environment (preferably 
  on a separate machine) and use a tool such as <B>rdist</B> to transfer the index 
  files to the production location.</P>
