</div><h1>DLXS Release 10 - 15 FEB 2003</h1><h2>General Information</h2>
<p>DLXS Release 10 is comprised of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>TextClass version 3.0.0</li>
          <li>BibClass version 2.3.0</li>
          <li>FindingAids version 2.1.0</li>
          <li>ImageClass version 2.5.0</li>
          <li>Broker20 version 1.0.0</li>
          <li>Collmgr version 3.0.0</li>
          <li>XClass version 2.0.0</li>
          <li>Lib version 3.0.0</li>
          <li>mrsid_retrieve version 1.3.1</li>
          <li>tif2web version 1.0.3</li>
          <li>dlxsd version 1.0.0 </li>
          <li>XPAT version 5.2.3</li>
        </ul>
      

      
        <h2>Known Problems</h2>
        
          <p>The SQL::Statement version 1.005 perl module is not backward compatible with version 0.1021.  Version 0.1021 was typical with Perl version 5.6.1 whereas 1.005 is typical of Perl 5.8.0. We recommend you install perl 5.8.0 and SQL::Statement 1.005 or higher.  The workaround mentioned below may not be required when SQL::Statement 1.006 becomes available.  Because of this the following constraints and workarounds apply.  </p>
          <ul>
            <li>collmgr
              <ul>
                <li>Functions normally with either 0.1021 or 1.005</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>dbmove
              <ul>
                <li>Functions normally moving CSV to MySQL under either 1.005 or 0.1021</li>
                <li>Incorrectly uppercases column names when moving MySQL to CSV under 1.005.  The workaround is to lower case the resulting column names using an ascii editor.</li>
                <li>Fails completely under 0.1021 moving CSV to MySQL or vice versa..</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>upgrade_1_2, upgrade_2_3
              <ul>
                <li>Functions normally upgrading a MySQL database under either 1.005 or 0.1021</li>
                <li>Incorrectly uppercases column names when upgrading CSV under 1.005.  The workaround is to lower case the resulting column names using an ascii editor.</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Lib version 3.0.0</h2>
        
          <h3>New and Changed Functionality</h3>

          
            <h4>lib</h4>


            <ul>
              <li> ApplicationResult.pm
      <ul>
                  <li>Significant enhancements to support TextClass sorting and results inter-filing.  Caching mechanism for performance.</li>
                  <li>Support ISO date in sorting</li>

            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li> BookBag.pm
      <ul>
                  <li>When removing an item from the bookbag
          if it is the last item for a collid, remove the collid
          so we wont try to search a bookbag collid list that
          has no idnos in it.</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li> CioFactory.pm
      <ul>
                  <li>Fix bug where database was always being
          read even if there was a cio already on the session.</li>
                  <li>Removed qw( :standard :html3 escape
          unescape escapeHTML ) from all "use CGI" pragmas.
          8% performance improvement.</li>
                  <li>Changed calls to html template handling
          to be in DlpsUtils rather than in each of the apps.
          Added to DlpsSession, DlpsUtils and LibGlobals data
          to hold a history of URLs to make assertions able
          to trace back a user's path to a bad URL. Previous
          subroutines like SetOriginalCgi are now SetOriginalCgiHistory
          and so on.</li>
                  <li>Remove $main::user[name|part] workdir
          syntax</li>
                  <li>Enhanced fallback for ImageClass using
          a new mode "groupcoll" which supports fallback for
          the case of a single c= appearing with a g= The fallback
          is from coll to group to default group to class. Also
          support for "defaultgroupid" in Collection table when
          it is added to the database schema. This allows singlecoll
          mode 'to fallback form coll to default group to class,
          again for ImageClass and probably TextClass.</li>

                  <li>AddClassObjects now take the requestedCollArr
          instead of grabbing it internally so we can add class
          objects on the fly for next/prev item links</li>
                  <li>Made it a crime to ask for a tco using
          an undef collid</li>
                  <li>Allow multiple ignoreon hosts</li>

            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li> DlpsUtils.pm
      <ul>

                  <li>Added html CHUNK handling subroutine.</li>
                  <li>Modified SingularizePluralizeTerm so
          term must match exactly so we can pass in keys likes

                  <li>added assertion for missing filename
          in resolution in GetDefaultFileForCGC(). if page=foobar
          the hash lookup for the corresponding filename fails
          and we end up resolving to a directory instead of
          a file and spew garbage.</li>
                  <li>Fix bug in BuildAuthPageContent() which
          caused a blank dlpserror page if $LibGlobals::gLoginUrl
          was empty (as it would be after a normal dlxs install.
          Fix bug in BuildLoginRedirect(). Url passed to the
          auth system needed to be URL escaped to fix: escape
          the URL string so it will survive URL unescaping by
          the auth system. In addition the auth system will
          replace ';' by '&amp;' for separators to work around the
          meta tag refresh parsing bug present in most browsers
          where a meta tag like &lt;META http-equiv="Refresh" content="1;
          URL=http://fizzie/text-idx?c=moa;sid=foo"> causes
          the sid following the second semicolon to be stripped</li>
                  <li>Added new system error message</li>
                  <li>Print trace if DEBUG or DLPS_DEV not
          just DLPS_DEV</li>
                  <li>Added RemoveXPATMetachars() called
          from enhanced Filter_NOTEn_NotesForText() to use content
          as well as ID to uniquify note.</li>
                  <li>Added dump of envvars to assertion
          email</li>

                  <li>Changed calls to html template handling
          to be in DlpsUtils rather than in each of the apps.
          Added to DlpsSession, DlpsUtils and LibGlobals data
          to hold a history of URLs to make assertions able
          to trace back a user's path to a bad URL. Previous
          subroutines like SetOriginalCgi are now SetOriginalCgiHistory
          and so on.</li>
                  <li>added comment to URL History</li>
                  <li>Remove hardcoded mail addr left in
          accidentally</li>

                  <li>Fix logic in GetDefaultFileForCGC().
          It needs to be told whether $filename came in as being
          explicitly set as tpl= for customization on the url
          or was derived from cgi parameters like page, view,
          or browse. In the explicit case the fallback is from
          collection to group but cannot proceed to class (because
          it's custom) whereas in the non-explicit case the
          fallback depends on the cross-collection mode i.e.
          on whether we're looking for collection, group or
          class templates.</li>
                  <li>fix SetOriginalCgiHistory() to allow
          for no $dso</li>
                  <li>Finally get fallback correct for tpl=
          parameter. The specified value of the tpl= parameter
          is a filename that falls back as a function of xcollmode
          (groups colls singlecollection) just like everything
          else</li>
                  <li>Enhanced fallback for ImageClass using
          a new mode "groupcoll" which supports fallback for
          the case of a single c= appearing with a g= The fallback
          is from coll to group to default group to class. Also
          support for "defaultgroupid" in Collection table when
          it is added to the database schema. This allows singlecoll
          mode 'to fallback form coll to default group to class,
          again for ImageClass and probably TextClass.</li>
                  <li>Remove '|' from the RemoveXPATMetachars()
          subroutine. It's not a metachar and we do not map
          it to a space in most all .dd's</li>
                  <li>Added semicolon to &amp;nbsp of environment
          variable dumping routine in DlpsUtils</li>
                  <li>Fix case in GetDefaultFileForCGC()
          SPECIAL CASE: for resolving tpl=file.tpl (e.g. browse.tpl).
          file.tpl must be located in coll, default group
          or (unlikely) class space: if $xcollMode is 'colls'
          because xc=1 (meaning we came from the cross-collection
          interface) but there is only once 'c' (user is navigating
          within a single collection) we need to make it look
          like we're in single collection mode for the purposes
          of resolution in this routine.</li>
                  <li>Added $gIdResolver to LibGlobals so
          that all classes may call it there. Also, moved the
          resolveIdToURL routine from ImageClass to DlpsUtils
          so that all can call it there.</li>
                  <li>Added "use LWP::Simple" so that call
          to IdResolver could be made.</li>
                  <li>added q4, q5 and q6 to terms that will
          be highlighted</li>
                  <li>SingularizePluralizeTerm() handles
          zero as the number as well as 1 or greater. If zero,
          return plural.</li>
                  <li>branches: 1.136.2; Fisheye routines
          now ASSERT if $script is not passed in.</li>
                  <li>added GenComputeTime</li>
                  <li>Needed new routine to get only the
          last CGI object from the CgiHistory.</li>
                  <li>Fix OELIG => OElig charent</li>
                  <li>Changed SingularizePluralizeTerm to
          send back originally passed in term, unchanged, if
          it is not found in the hash.</li></ul></li>

                  <li>Changed calls to html template handling

          Added to DlpsSession, DlpsUtils and LibGlobals data

                  <li>branches: 1.23.2; Added $gIdResolver
          to LibGlobals so that all classes may call it there.

        <h2>Text Class version 3.0.0</h2>
        
          <h3>New and Changed Functionality</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>TextClass
<ul>
                <li>TextClass has undergone significant re-architecture in order to implement sorting of results by author, title or date and, in cross-collection searches, to inter-file results from all selected collections.  </li>
                <li>The results list is now more consistent across encoding levels.  The initial results list consists of a bibliographic display per item.  </li>
                <li>The user may select a link on the to see detailed search results either as summaries of hits or as key-word-in-context (KWIC).  </li>
                <li>Full support for collection groups is now available via a "group select page" allowing the user to narrow their attention to search a group of related collections.  </li>
                <li>The cross-collection search page now displays the group (if any) within which the collections to be searched reside, along with the other available groups.</li>
                <li>TextClass default templates have been modularized so that, for example, the search page template is a single file supporting all of the search types via "chunks" of html that can be plugged into the master template. The navbar is also a module.  In general, this modularization should reduce the number of files that require modification to effect a site-wide change. </li></ul></li>
            <li> Pageviewer
                <ul>
                <li>Contone pages can now be displayed as well as bitonal pages.</li>
                <li> Pages can be associated with contone "figures" that appear in them.
When displaying the bitonal page, thumbnails of included figures, if
any, are displayed. Each thumbnail has a link built to ImageClass to
display a larger image, with all associated ImageClass behavior
(panning, zooming, etc.)</li>
                <li>There is a new table in the dlxs database called PageviewFig to hold
information about any figure images, and there is a new field in the
Pageview table to hold information about the bit depth of a page image
(related to whether it is bitonal, contone, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
             </li>

                  <li>Added debugging. Fixed sorting for
            the case where there are missing dates or authors.
            We have to do 2 queries: one for the dates and one
            for the titles in headers without dates and merge
            the results in an rset. Cant be done in one query
            because there are 2 regions (date and title) but the
            pr.region.... command only lets us spec one of them.
            The same for author too. Removed ALLSELECTED from
            the CGI object before constructing the cache key --
            ALLSELECTED is analogous to the cc -- it should not

                  <li>Enhanced Filter_NOTEn_NotesForText()
            to use content as well as ID to uniquify note.</li>

                  <li>More work on Filter_NOTEn_NotesForText
            allowing for note content having been previously highlighted
            by TextFilter()</li>

                  <li>Remove userpath, userpart old workdir

            after already having refined once, the search searches
            across that item. It use to search across the entire

            the search within a bookbag after already having refined
            once, the search searches across the contents of
            the bookbag. It use to search across the entire collection

                  <li>Creation of NAV_TAB_STYLE_OVERRIDES
          PI and supporting code and files.</li>
                  <li>Ongoing changes to search page handling.
          Added HIDDEN_XG PI and building of hidden "c" and
          building of collection list with checkboxes based
          on number of "c" params in URL.</li>

                  <li>Changed WW_NAV to look only and collection
          number and type rather than xcollmode.</li>
                  <li>Changed PI handler for TITLE to call
          HOME_LINK handler</li>
                  <li>Fixed up a couple of link building
          routines that need to set ALLSELECTED=1 and moved
          a tco access based on cc to the case where there'll
          actually be a cc.</li>
                  <li>Added tpl=home.tpl in "collection home"
          links in collection list of cross-collection mode.</li>

                  <li>In the building of a "word index" link
          in the nav bar's search pull down, added a test to
          see if in xcoll mode. So, even if there is only one
          c (that does have a word wheel index), no link to
          wordwheel will be built if there is a "xc" parameter.</li>
                  <li>In the building of a "word index" link
          in the nav bar's search pull down, changed the test
          to use the xcollmode saved on the $dso (which in turn
          meant passing the $dso to the IncludeExcludeNavLinks
          routine.</li>
                  <li>Changes to building of home link to
          use fallback for finding home.tpl.</li>
                  <li>Added xg parameter to links on groups
          (and "all collections" ) when in xg mode, so that
          the left frame (with aforementioned links) continues
          to be built.</li>
                  <li>Added logic to force intersection of
          values in region pulldown in search forms to 'full
          text' for simple and proximity and 'works' for other
          search types. Javascript in search.js will need to
          have the same logic (although it intersects values
          from the arrays built from the CGI grabbing colldb
          values).</li>
                  <li>Added IsItemLevelRegion()</li>
                  <li>Fixed searchhistory template PI handling

          selection code and the javascript arrays build on
          their basis</li>
                  <li>Fix search within, add alt to img tag
          for graphic title. There were diffs from main trunk</li>

                  <li>added &lt;?HIDDEN_DEBUG></li>
                  <li>Changed code in IncludeExcludeNavLinks
          to properly determine whether to include a wordwheel
          search link in the nav bar's Search popup menu.</li>

                  <li>Fix HIDDEN_VARS PI for bbagemail.tpl
          so that the c= parameter is among those added as hidden
          vars so that the cgi does not acquire all c= in the
          database and select the cross-collection template
          instead of the ACLS bbaglist.tpl</li>
                  <li>Removed qw( :standard :html3 escape
          unescape escapeHTML ) from all "use CGI" pragmas.
          8% performance improvement.</li>
                  <li>Changed calls to CgiToHtmlTemplate

          alt tag to img tag</li>
                  <li>Added PI's to display number of collections
          on line and number of text in the home.tpl template.</li>
                  <li>MakeTextOrGraphicLink: pass in an extra
          variable, $alt for the img alt tag. ProcessGraphicsPathPI
          ProcessJavascriptPathPI changed to handle fall back
          problems caused by groups.</li>
                  <li>added $piParamHashRef to BuildPullDown

        <h2>Image Class version 2.5.0</h2>
        
          <h3>New and Changed Functionality</h3>

          
            <h4>web/i/image</h4>

            <ul>
              <li> templates and style sheets
        <ul>
                  <li>
Significant changes were made to certain processing instructions. There is backward compatibility, however use of the PATH PI and the corresponding ImageClassUtils::pathByType subroutine is deprecated. A combination of the following PIs is now preferred: FBFILE (builds a link to a file in the web space using standard fallback mechanisms to determine the path), JAVASCRIPTURL, and CGIROOT.  Class level stylesheet files are now hardcoded paths relative to the web server docroot. Previously the paths were generated with a PI and fallback, which isn't actually appropriate since the class level style sheet file is always linked as a default. Also, an instance of the INSERTTEXT PI was added to the entry.tpl file. It is configured to insert into the template the contents of a file called "entryinfo.tpl". This is to facilitate the display of collection specific information in the entry template, such as a blanket copyright statement.
            </li>

                  <li>
The "onload" statement was removed from the BODY tag. It contained a javascript preload command that was attempting to load image files that do not exist and are not necessary. It also caused a lot of unnecessary server error log entries. The onload statement should be removed from all copies of the entry.tpl template.
            </li>


                  <li>
Templates were modified to fix a problem Netscape 4x had with the way the style sheets were being loaded.
             </li>

                  <li>
entry.tpl was modified to move the header into each div. this allows the current div view (full image, description, etc. ) to be "sticky" while navigating to next/prev entries. it also allows other aspects of the view to be "sticky", for example the image size viewed. other things are intentionally not "sticky", such as the zoom state.
             </li>

                  <li>
Minor aesthetic changes were made to the slice summary and fisheye. The extra bold tags were removed from around the summary/fisheye at the bottom of the results pages. The css now takes care of making the text bold. Also, a fisheye style was added in order to facilitate customization of the fisheye.
             </li>
                  <li>
reslist, thumbfull, and thumbnail templates were modified simply to set the alignment of the middle column of header 1 to "center". This should keep the "new search" link from colliding with the banner text as it has been.
             </li>
                </ul>
    </li>
            </ul>


            <ul>
              <li> js/imageclass.js
<ul>
                  <li>imageclass.js function "hide" was removed.
                The function "show" can now handle both show and hide.
                The "show" function was updated to support ns6 and
                ie6 in addition to ie4, ie5, and ns4. imageclass.js
                function "MM_showHideLayers" was rewritten to support
                ns6 and ie6 in addition to ie4, ie5, and ns4. Miscellaneous
                unused javascript functions were removed completely.
                The sniffBrowser function was added.</li>
                </ul>
</li>
            </ul>
          


          
            <h4>cgi/i/image</h4>

            <ul>


              <li>Image Class was checked for compatability
                with SGML that does and does not have new lines. Previously
                the middleware expected the SGML to have all newlines
                removed. Now it will work either way. One benefit
                of this is a reduction of storage space needed for
                prep files.</li>

              <li>The Image Class dependency on the group
                "all" has been removed. It is no longer necessary
                to have a group "all" and it is fine for a collection
                to not be any group whatsoever.</li>

              <li>Image Class now uses Lib fallback routines
                for choosing templates, graphics, css, javascript
                files. This, along with similar work done to Text
                Class and Bib Class brings consistency to the way
                the classes handle fallback. It also introduces fallback
                from the group to the class level, which is a significant
                and good change for Image Class. There is also support
                now for default groups to be specified per collection
                in the collection database (though at this moment
                the new field has not been added to the collection
                database.) Standardization of fallback led to global
                variable house cleaning in Image Class. ImageClassUtils::setupPaths
                has been eliminated, taking with it the globals hashes
                previously used for holding essential paths and urls.
                A few other global variables were consolidated or
                simply dropped if not needed.</li>

              <li>Features for turning a field in to
                a linked URL were added to ICLocalUtils::insertField.
                New PI parameters "baseurl" and "urltext" are now
                accepted.</li>

              <li>The Image Class index.tpl page can
                now have a search form on it, using relevant PIs,
                if desired.</li>

              <li>Image Class had been calling ciofactory
                twice in order to make sure that collids for items
                in a bookbag/portfolio were properly resolved and
                marked as requested. It accounted for the fact that
                sometimes bookbag items were coming from a collection
                that hadn't yet been requested/selected for searching.
                As it turns out, calling ciofactory a second time
                wasn't necessary. It works fine to just remove all
                c parameters from the cgi object, which is the same
                as requesting all collections. To make a long story
                short, the code that Image Class used to cull collids
                out of bookbag item ids and to call ciofactory a second
                time has been removed with no apparent side affects.</li>

              <li>A bug was fixed in ImageApp.pm where
                the string sId-placeholder was failing to get converted
                to sId-actualsessionid. This caused Portfolios to
                not work properly in the session-based model.</li>

              <li>An "addPI" command was strategically
                placed in ImageApp.pm so that the bbdel.tpl loads
                cascading style sheets properly. A global switch was
                added to Image Class to turn on and off PUBLIC portfolio
                functionality specifically. It is configurable in
                imageclass.cfg.</li>

              <li>
Modifications were made to the parsing of istruct ids which turned out to be unreliable in rare situations.</li>

              <li> Sorting of results
                was changed so that the default/unsorted order
                is data occurrence order.Results had been getting
                sorted by ID if nothing else. Sorting is now a wee
                bit faster as well. </li>
              <li>
Next/Prev entry navigation in
                the book bag had to be removed do to data retrieveal
                and sorting complications. It didn't work right before,
                so this is not a great loss.</li>

              <li>A global sort threshhold was added to Image Class.</li>

              <li>Changes were made to support "sticky"
                entry views while navigating using next/prev. </li>

              <li>Another minor change was made so that a message
                is left and an assertion error avoided if a portfolio
                item is not found.</li>

              <li>ImageClassUtils::entryDivDisplayButtons
                was changed to suppress display of the "view buttons"
                (for switching between "full image", "description",
                and "other views") in the situation where there is
                only 1 view configured for the collection in CollMgr.</li>

              <li>ImageClassUtils.pm was changed to support
                use of relative rather than absolute image file references
                in the img/index directory. ImageClassUtils.pm is
                backward compatible with previously created index
                directories.</li>

              <li>A bug was fixed in pageBanner subroutine
                that was causing failure of graphic banners.</li>

              <li>The window.opener options were changed
                for entry (full record) views to include menubar,
                location window functionality. Without menubar, it
                was hard to print. Without location, it was hard to
                determine the URL for the page.</li>

              <li>Image Class now utilizes DLXSDATAROOT.</li>

              <li>Certain characters are not allowed
                Image Class field names. makeCollectionmaps-pm now
                filters out such characters and prints a message saying
                it did so.</li>

              <li> AUTHZD_COLL_sample
            <ul>
                  <li>The AUTHZD_COLL file is no longer inluded in the DLXS distribution. AUTHZD_COLL_sample is included instead and can easily be copied to AUTHZD_COLL for use.</li>
                </ul>
       </li>
            </ul>
