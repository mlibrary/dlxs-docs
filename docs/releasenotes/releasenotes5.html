      <h1>DLXS Release 5 - 30 MAR 2001</h1><h2>General Information</h2>
      <p>This is the first release that incorporates all three Classes (Text,
			 Bib, Image) and the Finding Aid middleware in a single release.</p>
      
      
        <h2>XPAT version 5.2.3</h2>
        
          <h3>Enhancements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A new command option and argument to specify a sync message for
				  startup. The syntax is [-s [ syncargmsg ] ].</li>
          </ul>
        
        
          <h3>Known Problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><?xm-replace_text {LI}?></li>
          </ul>
        
      
      
        <h2>Text Class version 2.2.3</h2>
        
          <h3>Enhancements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        
        
          <h3>Known Problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        
      
      
        <h2>Bib Class version 2.0.2</h2>
        <p>This release is a significant re-development of BibClass which uses
			 the DLXS common library modules found in Lib. In particular, it uses a database
			 for collection data and session management for BookBag and Search History
			 functionality. </p>
        
          <h3>Enhancements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><?xm-replace_text {LI}?></li>
          </ul>
        
        
          <h3>Known Problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bugzilla #272: BibClass does not build links based on the
				  'host' field in the database so links to collections hosted on machines other
				  than the machine running bib-idx will point to to the local machine data which
				  usually does not exist (rather it is on a remote machine). This will only be a
				  problem if BibClass colldb contains rows for more than one host.</li>
          </ul>
        
      
      
        <h2>Image Class version 1.0.6</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li>The most current DLXS libraries are now used where applicable.
				  <ul>
                <li>DlpsUtils.pm</li>
                <li>DevUtils.pm </li>
                <li>QueryFactory.pm </li>
                <li>TerminologyMapper.pm </li>
                <li>XPat.pm </li>
                <li>XPatResult.pm</li>
                <li>XPatResultSet.pm</li>
              </ul> </li>
            <li>CGI parameters conform to DLXS standard</li>
            <li>Full conformance with standard directory structures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The primary goal was to make essential changes to keep pace with
				core DLXS developments. This was intentionally done without drastically
				modifying the architecture or functionality of the programs. Considerable
				architectural and functional enhancements are scheduled for version 2 of the
				Image Class, expected to be released in spring 2001.</p>
        
        
          <h3>Enhancements</h3>
          <p>There are a few remarkable enhancements in Version 1.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improved delivery of JPEGs extracted from SID files (better
				  caching, and believed to be faster) </li>
            <li>Improved results retrieval (faster retrieval for records with
				  multiple images) </li>
            <li>Unlimited Boolean query components (q1 .. qN)</li>
            <li>Support for advanced image structures (e.g., differentiation
				  between overviews and details) </li>
            <li>In the process of adding support for advanced image structures,
				  the transformation tools were significantly improved upon, further simplifying
				  collection deployment. </li>
            <li>Several bugs that caused XPAT sessions to run endlessly were
				  eliminated. </li>
            <li>Improved display in situations where thumbnails are not
				  available, especially for related views.</li>
            <li>Improved interface for navigating to related views from a
				  detail view. </li>
            <li>The transformation process can now find image filenames in any
				  number of specified fields.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Version 1 includes a significant DTD change, which requires
				collection metadata to be reprocessed. It is a general goal to keep DTD changes
				to an absolute minimum.</p>
        
        
          <h3>Dependencies</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The
				  <a href="http://www.dlxs.org/products/xpat.html">XPAT search
					 engine</a> </li>
            <li>
				  <a>MrSID</a> for compression and delivery of images online.</li>
            <li>
				  <a>sgmlnorm</a> for normalizing and validating SGML.</li>
          </ul>
        
      
      
        <h2>Finding Aids version 2.0.0</h2>
        
          <h3>Enhancements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><?xm-replace_text {LI}?></li>
          </ul>
        
        
          <h3>Known Problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><?xm-replace_text {LI}?></li>
          </ul>
        
      
      
        <h2>Lib version 2.1.1</h2>
        <p>This is the first release of the shared DLXS library modules
			 (collectively known as Lib). Release of Lib as a separately versioned
			 deliverable gives us needed flexibility to supply updates for functionality
			 enhancements and bug fixes and to better maintain backward-compatibility when
			 newer Lib versions are released.</p>
        
          <h3>Enhancements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>LibVersion.pm maintains the version number for Lib and via the
				  Perl 'use' statement allows programs to programatically ensure that the correct
				  level of functionality is present in the shared modules that compose Lib.</li>

            <li>A new module (GroupsInfo.pm) provides an interface to a DBI
				  table (
				  <tt>groups</tt>) which supports the grouping of collection into
				  named groups. This functionality is used in this release of BibClass.</li>
            <li>A new module (DbUtils.pm) provides a simple interface built on
				  top of DBI to connect to a CSV database, read a table and disconnect. </li>
            <li>Adapted sessions handling to use the new Apache::Session module
				  version 1.53 , and added configuration options the for the session data store
				  (File, MySQL, etc.)</li>
            <li>A subclass module (BookBagItem/BBItemBC.pm) provides a variant
				  of the BookBagItem class for use by BibClass.</li>
          </ul>
        
        
          <h3>Backward Compatibility</h3>
          <p>DLXS  #5 introduces 2 non-backward compatible changes as a
				result of the move to the Perl DBI database interface and the update of
				Apache::Session to version 1.53 with its correspondingly different file
				structure for session management</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The TextClass and BibClass configuration variable $gCollDbName
				  now points to the directory
				  <i>containing</i> the database tables rather than to the database
				  file (
				  <tt>colldb</tt>) itself. Because colldb is a DBI CSV table it can
				  contain neither blank lines nor comment (#) lines. The "s_" and "a_" data type
				  prefixes on the column heads have been eliminated also. To convert your colldb,
				  remove blank and comment lines and the "s_" and "a_" prefixes form the column
				  heads.</li>
            <li>The new session file structure now consists of a subdirectory
				  (e.g.
				  <tt>/tmp/sessions</tt> ) containing one file per session rather
				  than consisting of a single file maintaining all sessions. This change was
				  necessary due to problems with slow access to the CGI attributable to
				  contention for access to the single semaphore-protected file mechanism. In the
				  release, remove the session file and create a directory to hold the multiple
				  session files and a second directory (e.g.
				  <tt>/tmp/sessionslock</tt>) to hold the lock files which protect
				  the session files.</li>
          </ul>
        
        
          <h3>Known Problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>While much more difficult to reproduce that in the previous
				  release, due to a race condition, it is still possible to click "add to
				  bookbag" on multiple items rapidly enough to make the code fail to add one or
				  more of the clicked items to the BookBag.</li>
          </ul>
