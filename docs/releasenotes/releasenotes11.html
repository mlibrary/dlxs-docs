<h1>DLXS Release 11 - 5 DEC 2003</h1><h2>General Information</h2>
<p>DLXS Release 11 is comprised of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>BibClass version 3.1.0</li>
          <li>Broker20 version 1.1.0</li>
          <li>Collmgr version 3.1.0</li>
          <li>FindaidClass version 5.0.0</li>
          <li>ImageClass version 3.0.0</li>
          <li>Lib version 3.2.0</li>
          <li>TextClass version 3.2.0</li>
          <li>XClass version 2.1.0</li>
          <li>XPAT version 5.3.0</li>
          <li>XslFallback version 1.0.0</li>
          <li>IdResolver version 1.0.0</li>
          <li>dlxsd version 1.0.1 </li>
          <li>mrsid_retrieve version 1.3.1</li>
          <li>tif2web version 1.0.3</li>
          <li>kakadu version 4.0.2</li>
          <li>cjpeg version 6b</li>
        </ul>
      

      
        <h2>Known Problems</h2>
        
          <p>XPAT 5.3.0 is generally backward-compatible with indexes generated by 5.2.x subject to a few isolated
misses during searching.  Re-indexing with 5.3 xpatbld resolves this deficiency.</p>
        
        
          <p>The SQL::Statement version 1.005 perl module is not backward compatible with version 0.1021.  Version 0.1021 was typical with Perl version 5.6.1 whereas 1.005 is typical of Perl 5.8.0. We recommend you install perl 5.8.0 and SQL::Statement 1.005 or higher.  The workaround mentioned below may not be required when SQL::Statement 1.006 becomes available.  Because of this the following constraints and workarounds apply.  </p>
          <ul>
            <li>collmgr
              <ul>
                <li>Functions normally with either 0.1021 or 1.005</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>dbmove
              <ul>
                <li>Functions normally moving CSV to MySQL under either 1.005 or 0.1021</li>
                <li>Incorrectly uppercases column names when moving MySQL to CSV under 1.005.  The workaround is to lower case the resulting column names using an ascii editor.</li>
                <li>Fails completely under 0.1021 moving CSV to MySQL or vice versa..</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>upgrade_1_2, upgrade_2_3, upgrade_3_4
              <ul>
                <li>Functions normally upgrading a MySQL database under either 1.005 or 0.1021</li>
                <li>Incorrectly uppercases column names when upgrading CSV under 1.005.  The workaround is to lower case the resulting column names using an ascii editor.</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ul>
        
	
	  <h3>Image Class Known Problems</h3>
	  <ul>
<li>
The HTTP header is not being created properly by the getimage-idx cgi in Image Class (DLXS 11, 11a). The error is actually in Sidget2.pm at line 176. Here is the correction.
<br />
<pre>
$buf = qq{Content-type: $contentType\n} . $contentDisposition . qq{Content-length: $size\n\n};
</pre>
</li>

	    <li>Image filenames can not begin with the letter "x" (upper or lowercase). It is not certain when this problem was introduced, but it is believed to exist in DLXS 10. It is known to exist in DLXS 11 and 11a.</li>
	    <li>A media_table is needed more often than not. Documentation suggests otherwise.</li>
	    <li>Image Class data prep scripts assume prep directory is under $DLXSROOT, when $DLXSDATAROOT would be more appropriate. This is not likely to affect too many installations.</li>
	    <li>A "q" CGI parameter without a value generates an error if it
	      is sequenced between two other "q" parameters that do have values. e.g.,
	      q1=house q2= q3=country. This can happen when there are 3 or more text
	      fields in a search form and the user enters text in only the first and
	      last.</li>
	    <li>Display of JPEG2000 images as JPEG in the browser behaves oddly if
	      the image is zoomed several times near the edge of the
	      full image. The zoomed portion of the image is stretched to match
	      the aspect ratio of the full-size image. </li>
	    <li>"rgn" CGI parameters containing full field names generate an
	      error. The CGI now expects field abbreviations, not full field
	      names.</li>
	    <li>The "MEDIAEQUIVS" PI in entry.tpl and bbentry.tpl appears (as the
	      string "MEDIAEQUIVS") in Netscape Navigator 4.x when it really should
	      be hidden if not utilized.</li>
	  </ul>
	
      

      
        <h2>XPAT version 5.3.0</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li>5.3.0 is a major new release of XPAT.  Two new binaries, <b>xpatbldu</b> and <b>xpatu</b> enable indexing and searching of UTF-8 encoded Unicode XML data.  Full Unicode support in the middleware will become available in a following release.   In addition, "Lite" <i>non-Unicode</i> versions of these tools together with sgmlrgn and multirgn are now freely available without license fees and may be downloaded from http://www.dlxs.org.</li>
            <li>5.3.0 is generally backward-compatible with indexes generated by 5.2.x subject to a few isolated
misses during searching.  5.3 can read 5.2 indexes albeit with a warning that it is not possible for 5.3 to determine whether the Data Dictionary has changed since the 5.2 index was built because the integrity checksum for 5.3 indexes is different than for 5.2.   </li>
            <li>XPAT 5.2.x cannot read indexes generated by 5.3.  That is, 5.3 is not forward-compatible.</li>
            <li>Because XPAT 5.2.x cannot read indexes generated by 5.3 and because DLXS sites may continue to use 5.2 for a period of time we've chosen to deliver 5.2 versions of the sample data indexes.  </li>
            <li>With respect to Unicode support for element names and attribute names and values, xmlrgn is limited to Unicode code points in the range from 0 to 127 decimal, i.e. to USASCII values.   multirgn should be used to create region indexes for XML where element names and/or attributes and attribute values are outside this range.
   </li>
          </ul>
        
      

      
        <h2>Lib version 3.2.0</h2>
        
          <h3>New and Changed Functionality</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Support for CGM (Cornel--Goettingen-Michigan protocol</li>
            <li>New parent class DLXSClass with children BibClass, FullTextClass</li>
            <li>Support for newly released ID Resolver.</li>
            <li>New parent class PIFiller supporting subclasses PerlPIFiller and XsltPIFiller for Perl and XSLT filtering. </li>
          </ul>
          
            <h4>lib</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>New module CGMResult.pm to handle CGM result set</li>
              <li>Member data keys changed to lower case</li>
              <li>CollsInfo.pm: Addition of access methods for "globalnamespace"
                so that code could be shared. Also changed passing
                of object creation parameters as a hash rather than
                as an array.</li>
              <li>DbUtils.pm:  routines were added to
                to provide new basic functionality for storing and
                retrieving rows.</li>
              <li>LibGlobals.cfg: Updated configuration of idresolver. The $gIdResolver variable is
                now initially set to the value of the virtual host
                for the idresolver rather than the URL for the idresolver. </li>
              <li>New module PIFiller.pm with subclasses PerlPIFiller.pm and XsltPIFiller.pm generalizing the filtering of XML for output.</li>
              <li>QueryFactory.pm: Changed 'and' to 'or in NaturalLanguageBaseQuery
                in the case where the search type is 'simple' and
                there are multiple q1's since the query is logically
                q1 + q1 + ... + q1 i.e. a disjunction not a conjunction. Change an '&amp;' character into '&amp;amp;' which is the form it must have in XML so user can
                search for e.g. "Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water" but protect
                actual entered character entity references like '&amp;eacute;'.</li>
            </ul>
          

          
            <h4>bin/db</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>upgrade_3_4 utility provided to upgrade to version 4 of database.</li>

            <p>Obsolete fields in this release are as follows (TableName:fieldname):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>BibClass:dddir</li>
              <li>ImageClass:dddir</li>

                type pages.</li>
            </ul>
          

          
            <h4>bin/t/text, bin/WW</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>importpageviewdata.pl: enhancements: * after processing a
                page metadata file, remember the maximum page sequence
                number encountered and purge any page metadata in
                the database for page sequences greater than that
                (potentially) new maximum </li>

          </ul>
          
            <h4>web/b/bib</h4>

        <h2>Image Class version 3.0.0</h2>
        
          <h3>New and Changed Functionality</h3>
	  <ul><li>MySQL is supported in addition to XPAT for searching collection metadata. XPAT will likely not be supported in future releases of Image Class.</li>
	    <li>JPEG2000 is supported in addition to MrSID. Behavior is identical. JPEG2000 command line compression/decompression utilities are provided.</li>
	    <li>Configuration of field abbreviations and labels, as well as the mapping of fields for cross-collection searching, is now done in Collmgr.
	      Collectionmaps.pm and makeCollectionmaps-idx are no lnger used.</li>
	    <li>The form of field abbreviations has changed. "dots" are no longer allowed. SGML may continue to have dots, no need to redo data.
	      As field abbreviations are migrated to Collmgr they must have "dots" converted to underscores.</li>
	    <li>The Collmgr field "dfltsrchflds" now must include an abbreviation in the form "collid_all" to enable searching of the entire record.
	      This field should be mapped to ic_all in the field_xcoll_maps Collmgr field for full record searching in across collections.</li>
	    <li>MySQL table structure for Portfolios has changed for increased data stability.</li>
	    <li>Media support has been improved. Practically any form of media (QuickTime, Flash, MP3) can be included in Image Class. Level of support varies. Configuration of imageprep has changed significantly.</li>
	  </ul>
          
            <h4>web/i/image</h4>

	    <ul><li>bbentry.tpl
		<ul><li>changed dlxs.ma to dlxs_ma</li>
		  <li>A PI was added to entry.tpl and bbentry.tpl
		    called "MEDIAEQUIVSTOOL" which displays links for
		    viewing item in different media formats. Anticipated
		    use is for video in more than one format.</li></ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <ul><li>bbthumbfull.tpl
		<ul><li>bbthumbfull.tpl: significant changes
		    were made in order to support scrollable iframes on
		    the portfolio thumbfull pages. the same changes could
		    be applied to the thumbfull.tpl template.</li>

		</ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <ul><li>search.tpl
		<ul><li>Replaced missing javascript loading
		    element that caused the search tips not to open when
		    requested.</li>
		  <li>small style change</li>
		  <li>style tweak</li>
		  <li>Changed search.tpl and searchgroup.tpl
		    to use "TIPSURL" PI.</li></ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <ul><li>searchgroup.tpl
		<ul><li>announcement tweaks</li>
		  <li>Changed search.tpl and searchgroup.tpl
		    to use "TIPSURL" PI.</li></ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <ul><li>css/imageclass-ie-mac.css
		<ul><li>A few styles definitions were added
		    related to display of the bbthumbfull page.</li>
		  <li>Added style used to display a message
		    when there are no related views for an item and a
		    mysql media table is not being used with the colllection.</li>
		  <li>added toolsbg style def</li></ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <ul><li>graphics/recinit.jpg
		<ul><li>this new graphic is used as part of
		    the "help" display in the bbthumbfull display.</li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <ul><li>js/imageclass.js
		<ul><li>changes to support move away from Collectionmaps.pm
		    to collmgr management of field mappings, labels, etc.</li>
		  <li>imageclass.js: significant changes
		    were made in order to support scrollable iframes on
		    the portfolio thumbfull pages.</li></ul>
	      </li>

	    </ul>



          

          
            <h4>cgi/i/image</h4>

	    <ul><li>ICLocalUtils.pm
		<ul><li>Changes were made to improve support
		    for media formats other than images. Also, minor changes
		    were made to enable the reduction of customized templates.
		    In other words, some basic generalizations were made
		    so that class or group level templates can do the
		    job.</li>
		  <li>Dropped reference to Collectionmaps.pm,
		    which isn't used anymore.</li>
		</ul></li>
	    </ul>
	    <ul><li>ImageApp.pm
		<ul><li>Fix server error: changed __AdjustOccurrenceCounts()
		    to AdjustOccurrenceCounts() for ARO changes to xclass.</li>
		  <li>Made a change to ImageApp so that portfolios
		    can find items that have old ID delims. Made a change
		    to Image Class Utils to support new and old delims
		    in nextpreventry.</li>
		  <li>Small changes to make portfolios work
		    properly with new as well as old isentryid delimiters.</li>
		  <li>Fixed a bug that had disabled adding
		    to or deleting from Bookbag/Portfolio. Also made retrieval
		    of existing BookBag items more robust in the sense
		    that it now is better about retrieving and deleting
		    items with ids that are in older forms.</li>
		  <li>Parameters passed to object creation
		    now a hash instead of an array.</li>
		  <li>Major changes were made in order to
		    add support for mySQL to image class. ImageApp methods
		    were shifted and/or partitioned in order to simplify
		    subclassing for mySQL. With this commit, both xpat
		    and mysql should be largely functional. XClass searching
		    needs to be tested. The changes for mySQL provided
		    an opportune time to stop the use of full region names
		    in rgn parameters and to stop using Collectionmaps.pm.
		    These changes are complete with the exception if needing
		    some validity checking of rgn parameters.</li>
		  <li>Changed all member data keys to lowercase
		    (ciowrapper, session, cgi, etc.)</li>
		  <li>made to be compatable with lib changes.
		    also fixed bug in portfolios where missing items were
		    not being displayed as "missing" they were simply
		    not being displayed. other changes included a fix
		    for the problem where xcoll field data would not display
		    (e.g., dlxs_ma) and other little things.</li>
		  <li>Changes were made to ImageApp.pm, ImageClassUtils.pm,
		    and imageclass.cfg to abandon the use of "storable"
		    freeze and thaw for the long-term storage of BookBag
		    items. The new mechanism stores BookBag items in a
		    seperate table, one per row. The freeze/thaw approach
		    was occassionally storing BookBags that could not
		    be thawed. The root of the problem was never discovered.
		    To faciliate this change and to migrate data from
		    the frozen storage to the new table, a script called
		    convertBookBag.pl has been created and can be found
		    in bin/i/image. It is important to read the comments
		    in the head of the convertBookBag.pl file to understand
		    the steps required to make this transition smoothely.</li>
		  <li>Natural language query string now displays
		    properly on "no results" page. It was failing perhaps
		    due to a race condition related to the cgi redirect
		    that followed and storage of the natlangquery on the
		    session. Also fixed a bug with portfolios. When last
		    item of portfolio was deleted, an internal server
		    error occurred due to an attempt to insert non-existant
		    data rows into the BookBagItems table at the time
		    of storage.</li>
		  <li>Changes were made to improve support
		    for media formats other than images. Also, minor changes
		    were made to enable the reduction of customized templates.
		    In other words, some basic generalizations were made
		    so that class or group level templates can do the
		    job.</li>
		  <li>Greater support for media formats was
		    added, which for ImageApp mostly meant the additon
		    of a pi handler for the mediaequivstool.</li>
		  <li>A request for a bookmarked portfolio
		    would not redirect to the login page if the user was
		    not logged in. Now it does.</li>
		  <li>A request for a bookmarked portfolio
		    would not redirect to the login page if the user was
		    not logged in. Now it really does.</li>
		  <li>Cleaned up code and added comments
		    related to BookBag / Portfolio changes.</li>
		  <li>ImageApp.pm::forceAuth now checks,
		    when opening portfolio, to see if the user is authed,
		    and if not, redirects to auth. this is most likely
		    to occur when a portfolio page has been bookmarked.
		    previously the behavior was to display the items the
		    user is authorized to use, but this could be confusing.</li>
		  <li>ImageApp.pm: support for TOTALRESULTS
		    PI was added to results handler. It simply inserts
		    the number of total results. The intended use is in
		    bbthumbfull.tpl (portfolios) to create a referenceable
		    javascript variable that knows the total number of

		    ImageClassUtils.pm: Primarily, changes were made to
		    support new functionality in portfolio's "thumb with
		    full record" view. iFrames are now used to allow scrolling
		    of thumbs while keeping the full record in it's place.
		    This functionaly can also be used in the regular (non-porfolios)
		    "thumb with full record" view, though it has not yet
		    been applied. Care was taken to maintain backward
		    compatibility with existing templates. As of this
		    commit, however, it is most likely that NS Nav 4.x
		    has some disfunctioning portfolio functions. Namely,
		    check/uncheck all items. imageclass.cfg: Minor changes
		    were made to "help" text for thumbfull views. Also
		    minor changes to the global var gWindowProps, which
		    specifies how certain pop-up windows are to be created.</li>
		  <li>Minor changes to further advance support
		    for mysql. Added data_table field to collmgr. Changed
		    code to use data_table field. Changed nature of media_table
		    field. Instead of "yes"/"no" values, it now holds
		    the name of the media_table. Code was updated to use
		    media_table in this new way.</li>
		  <li>Added support for 'SID' PI to all page
		    handlers. Dropped a related but unused subroutine
		    sidParam from ImageClassUtils.</li>
		  <li>Fixed a bug that caused portfolios
		    to fail to display items in all cases. Stemmed from
		    Lib change that added cio to the list of parameters
		    passed to BookBagItem for initialization. Also added
		    use of new mediahost colldb field, which allows the
		    server that delivers images to be specified per collection.
		    The default is still specified in imageclass.cfg.</li>
		  <li>Corrected a bug in the way links from
		    coll pages to group pages were built. Relates to GROUPSLINK
		    pi.</li>
		  <li>JPEG2000 support was added to the middleware.
		    Also made a small change to mysqlImageApp.pm so that

		  <li>A small fix to ImageClassUtils.pm ThumbRecordFilt
		    which was not reading collmgr field properly when

		  <li>Fixed a bug that had disabled adding

		    items with ids that are in older forms.</li>
		  <li>Major changes were made in order to
		    add support for mySQL to image class. ImageApp methods
		    were shifted and/or partitioned in order to simplify
		    subclassing for mySQL. With this commit, both xpat
		    and mysql should be largely functional. XClass searching
		    needs to be tested. The changes for mySQL provided
		    an opportune time to stop the use of full region names
		    in rgn parameters and to stop using Collectionmaps.pm.
		    These changes are complete with the exception if needing
		    some validity checking of rgn parameters.</li>
		  <li>made to be compatable with lib changes.
		    also fixed bug in portfolios where missing items were
		    not being displayed as "missing" they were simply
		    not being displayed. other changes included a fix
		    for the problem where xcoll field data would not display
		    (e.g., dlxs_ma) and other little things.</li>
		  <li>minor fixes. recordFilter section labels
		    are no longer lowercased.</li>
		  <li>made a small fix to record filt to
		    stop "empty" fields from displaying</li>
		  <li>Image Class middleware was altered
		    to allow the maximum viewable image size to be restricted
		    based on the value of the imgsizemax collmgr field.</li>
		  <li>Changes were made to ImageApp.pm, ImageClassUtils.pm,
		    and imageclass.cfg to abandon the use of "storable"
		    freeze and thaw for the long-term storage of BookBag
		    items. The new mechanism stores BookBag items in a
		    seperate table, one per row. The freeze/thaw approach
		    was occassionally storing BookBags that could not
		    be thawed. The root of the problem was never discovered.
		    To faciliate this change and to migrate data from
		    the frozen storage to the new table, a script called
		    convertBookBag.pl has been created and can be found
		    in bin/i/image. It is important to read the comments
		    in the head of the convertBookBag.pl file to understand
		    the steps required to make this transition smoothely.</li>
		  <li>Natural language query string now displays
		    properly on "no results" page. It was failing perhaps
		    due to a race condition related to the cgi redirect
		    that followed and storage of the natlangquery on the
		    session. Also fixed a bug with portfolios. When last
		    item of portfolio was deleted, an internal server
		    error occurred due to an attempt to insert non-existant
		    data rows into the BookBagItems table at the time
		    of storage.</li>
		  <li>Changes were made to improve support
		    for media formats other than images. Also, minor changes
		    were made to enable the reduction of customized templates.
		    In other words, some basic generalizations were made
		    so that class or group level templates can do the
		    job.</li>
		  <li>A minor change was made to the method
		    that concatenates meta field values so that it skips
		    empty fields.</li>
		  <li>Fixed a bug where keylinks in thumbfull
		    results view were being built without a "c" parameter.</li>
		  <li>added basic support for turning urls
		    into links in fields.</li>
		  <li>Greater support for media formats was
		    added, which for ImageClassUtils.pm included a great
		    number of changes to the following subroutines...
		    imageDecision, parseImgInf, parseImgInfVariations,
		    and a few others to a lesser degree. Also, use of
		    the subroutine _ParamsToURL was dropped in favor of
		    the existing CGI method self_url.</li>
		  <li>_ParamsToURL subroutine deleted.</li>
		  <li>minor "view for type" changes</li>
		  <li>Fixed bug in ImageClassUtils::convertInfFileData.
		    Extensions were not being parsed from filenames properly.</li>
		  <li>ImageApp.pm: support for TOTALRESULTS
		    PI was added to results handler. It simply inserts
		    the number of total results. The intended use is in
		    bbthumbfull.tpl (portfolios) to create a referenceable
		    javascript variable that knows the total number of
		    results. This addition allowed the PI THUMBFULLJSARRAYS

		    mode, which is only available in version 4.0.2 or
		    newer of MySQL.</li>
		  <li>Fixed a bug in the use of "Boolean"
		    mysql searching.</li>
		  <li>Clarified query building options for
		    mysql in code and in comments.</li>
		  <li>Minor mod to distinguish between an
		    undef and an empty media_table field.</li>
		  <li>Modified the tagDBdata subroutine to
		    handle the most basic image filename extensions (without
		    needing to have a media table). Specifically, deals
		    with the situation where the image filename field
		    contains a filename that includes a filename extension.
		    If extensions other than tif, tiff, jpg are encountered,
		    a media table is required. It is also OK not to have
		    a filename extension.</li>
		  <li>Minor change to getimage-idx to add
		    handling of tif, tiff, jpg extensions when there is
		    not a media_table.</li>
		  <li>Fixed bug that caused record and image
		    counts to fail with mysql colls.</li>
		  <li>Added phrase searching of a specified
		    field in order to enable accurate retrieval of IDs
		    that have non-alpha-numeric chars. The field can be
		    specfied in the field_admin_maps field of collmgr.</li>
		  <li>Fixed bug that caused assertion error
		    when the user does not use the first search box.</li>
		  <li>Fixed a bug in the bug fix that caused
		    assertion error when the user does not use the first
		    search box.</li>
		  <li>JPEG2000 support was added to the middleware.
		    Also made a small change to mysqlImageApp.pm so that
		    it gets the data table name from Collmgr rather than
		    basing it on the collid.</li>
		  <li>Corrected a bug in sorting when only
		    1 coll of group searched.</li></ul>
