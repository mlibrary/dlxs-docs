    <!-- Known Problems -->

    <h2>Known Problems</h2>

    <h3>Database</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> If this is a first-time install of DLXS it is necessary to
        lowercase the column headings in all of the CSV files under
        /misc/db before you run DLXSROOT/bin/db/dbmove to populate the
        MySQL database or run using the CSV database natively.  Use a
        text editor for this purpose.  Field names need be lowercase to
        be compatible with the underlying middleware.  This problem is
        due to a difference between SQL::Statement 1.005 and 0.1021.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Database Installation Notes</h3>
    <p>There are four new fields
      in 12a.  There is no upgrade script for 12 to 12a.  Instead, in
      certain cases, you will use collmgr to add these fields to your
      existing database as described below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Field (optional): <b>authsystems:</b> by default, does not
        have to be added.  You must add it via collmgr with the
        appropriate values if you choose to subclass the new AuthNZ
        module to support an authentication/authorization system based
        on other than the AUTHZ_COLL, REMOTE_USER and PUBLIC_COLL
        environment variables. This field is a member of the
        <tt>Collection</tt> table (all classes).
      </li>

      <li>Field (optional): <b>range_srchfields:</b> specifies the
        fields to be used for date range searching.  This is beta
        functionality in Image Class.  This field is a member of the
        <tt>ImageClass</tt> table. Add it using collmgr if you want to
        use the functionality.
      </li>

      <li>Field (optional): <b>privileged_users:</b> lists IDs for
        users with special privileges allowing access to images
        otherwise restricted or limited by size.  This field is a member
        of the <tt>ImageClass</tt> table. Add it using collmgr if you
        want to use the functionality.
      </li>

      <li>Field (optional): <b>browseupdatemodule:</b> specifies the
        name of the browse update Perl module. This is analogous to
        e.g. the <tt>appmodule</tt> and <tt>subclassmodule</tt> fields.
        This field supersedes a Perl configuration hash used in release
        12.  If you plan to use dynamic browsing you must add this field
        using collmgr to the <tt>Collection</tt> table (all classes).
        The module files are located in <tt>DLXSROOT/bin/browse</tt>.
        If a dynamic browse page is to be served this field must have a
        value.  The default behavior is available using one of the
        values <tt>BrowseUpdate/ImageMysqlBU</tt> or
        <tt>BrowseUpdate/FindaidBU</tt> for ImageClass and FindaidClass,
        respectively. The TextClass values depend on the
        <tt>encodingtype</tt> of the collection.  For
        <tt>monograph</tt>, <tt>serialissue</tt> or
        <tt>serialarticle</tt> the values are
        <tt>BrowseUpdate/MonographBU</tt>,
        <tt>BrowseUpdate/SerialIssueBU</tt> and
        <tt>BrowseUpdate/SerialArticleBU</tt>, respectively.  Newspapers
        are a specialization of the serialissue encoding type.
      </li>
    </ul>



    <!-- New and Changed Functionality -->

    <h2>New and Changed Functionality</h2>

    <h3><a name="xpat" id="xpat"></a>XPAT</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="lib"></a>Lib </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The authentication module AuthNZ.pm was added supporting the
        Athens Access Management auth system.  It is also extensible to
        support other authentication/authorization systems via
        subclassing.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem in the file
        DLXSROOT/lib/DlpsSession.pm. The manifestations are: 1) loss of
        search history 2) loss of bookbag contents 3) inability to
        progress through different "slices" of results. Since search
        history, bookbag and sort order of results are all saved in the
        session, the fact that a new session was being created each time
        the middleware ran lost whatever might have been saved in the
        previous session. </li>
      <li>Added the ability, at install-time, to choose sendmail or smtp to deliver mail from
        BookBag. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><a name="text"></a>Text Class </h3>
    
    
    <ul>
      <li>Renamed cached xml files in pageviewer, to solve a browser
        caching condition that prevented some users from changing
        pages. 
      </li> 
      <li> Lots of small xsl fixes. Some related to
        displaying kwics in detail views in scopedivs.xsl are
        significant. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3><a name="image"></a>Image Class </h3>


    <ul>
      <li>XPAT support removed. Significant reduction of code and
        more effective and efficient use of MySQL. All image collections
        must now use MySQL.</li>

      <li>The value of the appmodule field in Collmgr must be set to "ImageApp" for all Image Class collections. Failure to do so will likely result in the middleware failing to run with errors regarding "mysqlImageApp.pm" not being found.</li>

      <li>Class object added, finally making Image Class a "class"
        in terms of object oriented code.</li>

      <li>CSS improvements. Most notably affecting the processing of
        the display header. Local customizations of display header CSS and
        XSL will need some basic migration work. Added the ability to have
        page/view specific CSS overrides. In general, more cosmetic
        customizations can be done in CSS without touching the XSL or Perl.</li>

      <li>Several interface improvements, primarily in the area of
        results display. Fixed header display, better "image with full
        record" display. Less javascript. Better use of CSS. "Next" and
        "previous" link functionality for portfolios.</li>

      <li>Search result identifiers are no longer cached on the session.
        These changes address subtle but serious problems introduced with
        storage of the session ID in a cookie rather than on a URL parameter.
        The problems were only apparent when paging to next/previous items
        based on separate searches in two windows of a browser.</li>

      <li>Query building module rewritten for Image Class.</li>

      <li>Beta version of date range searching.</li>
    </ul>



    <h3><a name="bib"></a>Bib Class</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>SRU functionality added. A new program called "sru" will
        search bibclass databases using SRU commands and return XML. We
        have already implemented OAIster; implementing other bibclass
        databases should be fairly simple.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="bibperm"></a>Bibperm (Nameresolver)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation added.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="broker20"></a>Broker20</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No changes.</li>
    </ul>



    <h3><a name="collmgr"></a>Collmgr</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The database version (5) for 12a is identical to 12 with the
        exceptions noted in Database Know Problems.</li>
    </ul>





    <h3><a name="findaid"></a>FindaidClass </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lots of xsl fixes, mostly display of different content in
        different views: accessrestrict in container list, extent in top
        level did, creator, chronlists in tables, highlighting of hits,
        unitdate within unittitle, eventgrps and events</li>

      <li>Fixes of bugs including calculation and display of number
        of collections and finding aids, better browsing using creator.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3><a name="xclass"></a>XClass</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name=""></a>Tif2web binary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A new version 1.0.4. Rectangle highlighting for word coordinate highlighting uses.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3><a name="xclass"></a>XClass</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="mets"></a>METS Pageturner</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A METS pageturner--this is something we've been working on
        and is not yet officially in production, but we'll include it in
        this release. We developed this pageturner to work with the
        materials that Google is scanning, but the very simple design
        should work with just about any METS documents and accompanying
        XSLT and CSS files.  It's a prototype, so it is optimized for
        our environment--for instance, it queries our Aleph OPAC via the
        XServer, and also queries a MySQL rights database for each
        item.</li>
    </ul>
