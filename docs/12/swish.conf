# DIRECTIVES COMMON to  HTTP and FILESYSTEM METHODS
###################################################

IndexDir /l1/web/d/dlxs/docs/12
# For the FileSystem Method:
# This is a space-separated list of files and
# directories you want indexed. You can specify
# more than one of these directives.
#
# For the HTTP Method:
# Use the URL's from which you want the spidering
# to begin.
# NOTE: use  hmtl files rather than  directories
# for this method.

IndexFile /l1/web/d/dlxs/docs/12/swish.index
# This is what the generated index file will be.

IndexName "Site Index"
#IndexDescription "Default Index" 
#IndexPointer "http://www.cgi101.com/"
#IndexAdmin "Webmaster (webmaster@yoursite.com)"
# Extra information you can include in the index file.

# MetaNames first author
# List of all the meta names used in the file to index, must be on one line.
# If no metanames DO NOT deleted the line.

IndexReport 3
# This is how detailed you want reporting. You can specify numbers
# 0 to 3 - 0 is totally silent, 3 is the most verbose.

FollowSymLinks no
# Put "yes" to follow symbolic links in indexing, else "no".

#UseStemming no
# Put yes to apply word stemming algorithm during indexing,
# else no. See the manual for info about stemming. Default is 
# no.

#PropertyNames author
# List of meta tags names that can be retrieved with the -p option.
# Index size increases as by the formula in the manual.
# Comment out if no PropertyNames. Case insensitive

IgnoreTotalWordCountWhenRanking yes
# Put yes to ignore the total number of words in the file
# when calculating ranking. Often better with merges and
# small files. Default is no.

#ReplaceRules remove "modules/"
#ReplaceRules replace "[a-z_0-9]*_m.*\.html" "index.html"
# ReplaceRules allow you to make changes to file pathnames
# before they're indexed. This directive uses C library
# regex.h regular expressions.
# NOTE: do not use replace <string> "" to remove a string,
# use remove <string> instead - you might get a core dump otherwise.

#MinWordLimit 5
# Set the minimum length of an indexable word. Every shorter word
# will not be indexed.
# Commenting out the line will give the defaults

#MaxWordLimit 5
# Set the maximum length of an indexable word. Every longer word
# will not be indexed.
# Commenting out the line will give the defaults

#WordCharacters abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\&#;0123456789.@|,-'"[](~!@$%^{}_+?
# WORDCHARS is a string of characters which SWISH permits to
# be in words. Any strings which do not include these characters
# will not be indexed. You can choose from any character in
# the following string:
#
# abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_\|/-+=?!@$%^'"`~,.[]{}()
#
# Note that if you omit "0123456789&#;" you will not be able to
# index HTML entities. DO NOT use the asterisk (*), lesser than
# and greater than signs (<), (>), or colon (:).
#
# Including any of these four characters may cause funny things to happen.
# NOTE: Do not escape \ nor " and they cannot be the first letter in the string
# Commenting out the line will give the defaults

#BeginCharacters m"
# Of the characters that you decide can go into words, this is
# a list of characters that words can begin with. It should be
# a subset of (or equal to) WordCharacters
# Same rule of syntax as for WordCharacters

#EndCharacters \"\
# Of the characters that you decide can go into words, this is
# a list of characters that words can end with. It should be
# a subset of (or equal to) WordCharacters
# Same rule of syntax as for WordCharacters

#IgnoreLastChar 
# Array that contains the char that, if considered valid in the middle of 
# a word need to be disreguarded when at the end. It is important to also
# set the given char's in the ENDCHARS array, otherwise the word will not
# be indexed because considered invalid.
# Commenting out the line will give the defaults
# NOTE: if " is the first char in the string it needs to be escaped with \
# Do not escape otherwise

#IgnoreFirstChar 
# Array that contains the char that, if considered valid in the middle of
# a word need to be disreguarded when at the beginning. This was to solve
# the problem of parenthesis when there is no space between ( and the
# beginning of the word.
# Remember to add the char's to the BEGINCHARS list also.
# Commenting out the line will give the defaults
# NOTE: if " is the first char in the string it needs to be escaped with \
# Do not escape otherwise

# IgnoreLimit 80 1000
# This automatically omits words that appear too often in the files
# (these words are called stopwords). Specify a whole percentage
# and a number, such as "80 256". This omits words that occur in
# over 80% of the files and appear in over 256 files. Comment out
# to turn of auto-stopwording.

#IgnoreWords SwishDefault
# The IgnoreWords option allows you to specify words to ignore.
# Comment out for no stopwords; the word "SwishDefault" will
# include a list of default stopwords. Words should be separated by spaces
# and may span multiple directives.

IndexComments 0
# This option allows the user decide if to index the comments in the files
# default is 1. Set to 0 if comment indexing is not required.

# DIRECTIVES for FILESYSTEMS ONLY 
# Comment out if using HTTP

IndexOnly .html
# Only files with these suffixes will be indexed.

NoContents .gif .xbm .au .mov .mpg .pdf .ps .jpg .png
# Files with these suffixes will not have their contents indexed -
# only their file names will be indexed.

#FileRules pathname contains .*dir1
#FileRules filename contains # % ~ .bak .orig .old old.
#FileRules title contains construction example pointers
#FileRules directory contains .htaccess
#FileRules filename is index
# Files matching the above criteria will *not* be indexed.
# The pattern matching uses the C library regex.h
