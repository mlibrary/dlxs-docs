<div class="pageTitle">The Findaid Class DTD</div>
<p>The DTD used by the DLXS Findaid Class is essentially identical to the EAD2002
   DTD. For more information on the EAD2002 DTD, please visit the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/" target="external">Library
   of Congress EAD2002 web site</a>. The only difference is that the dlxsead2002.dtd
   has one extra element defined that wraps any number ead elements. In this
   way, we can create a collection of individual ead elements; i.e., a collection
   of individual finding aids.</p>
<p><span class="pageTitle">Encoding your EAD </span></p>
<p>DLPS does not have any preferred methods or quick and easy tools for this
   stage of the process. Only you, looking at your texts and your encoding practices,
   can do the intellectual work required to encode your finding aids in XML using
the EAD 2002 DTD. </p>
<h3 class="sectionheader">Practical
EAD Encoding Issues </h3>
<p>There are, however, two areas of practice that can have an effect on your
   online collection that are outside of hands-on encoding or conversion of word
   processed finding aids. One is the use of IDs as attributes on elements. I
   want to make it clear that we are NOT talking about the <span class="unixcommand">eadid</span> here,
   but refer to IDs used to identify the element so that it can be referred to,
   or referenced from, somewhere else. You no doubt all know that each ID within
   a document must be unique (and the DTD enforces this). However, you may not
   have thought about the consequences of joining all your finding aids into
   one collection. Your IDs will need to be unique across the entire collection.
   One way to ensure this is to prefix ID values with the eadid for a given document.
   At this time, there is no functionality in DLXS that requires you to have
   IDs on any elements, but you may have used them for your own internal purposes.
   Here at DLPS, we have run into this ourselves and are simply giving a heads-up,
   on the theory that our problems are fairly typical.</p>
<p>Another issue that you might run into, especially if you are migrating finding
   aids from SGML EAD 1.0 to XML EAD 2002, is that of handling special characters.
   If you are authoring finding aids in multiple languages in XML using some
   XML authoring tool, this is unlikely to be a problem for you -- you are aware
   of the issues, UTF-8 is the default encoding for XML, you will have no problems.
   You'll just want to make sure to index with the UTF-8
   enabled version of XPAT. If you have finding
   aids with multiple languages and/or special characters, you have probably
   thought this through already. However, if you have the occasionally e acute
   (&eacute;)
   in your SGML finding aid, you'll need to think about what you want to do with
   these characters. A straight converstion from SGML to XML will probably convert
   your character entities (for example, <span class="unixcommand">&amp;eacute;</span>)
   in your files to numeric entities (for example, <span class="unixcommand">&amp;#233;</span>).
   While this is valid, it will present a problem with regard to searching. XPAT
   will treat this as a string of characters, and in order to search for bless&eacute;d,
   you would need to key in bless&amp;#233;d. If all your special characters
   are ISO Latin 1, you can convert them to their 8-bit equivalents and index
   as usual. If you have a mixture, UTF-8 is the way to go. Again, this is merely
   a heads up. Note that the sample finding aids supplied with the release were
   chosen for their size and linking behaviors; they are sadly conventional
   in their use of character entities (ampersand only, in fact).</p>
