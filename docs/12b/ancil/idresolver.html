    <h1><a name="idresolver" id="idresolver"></a>IDRESOLVER</h1>
    <p>IDRESOLVER is a simple mechanism for resolving a unique ID to a URL. The
      DLXS Classes can use it to, for example, link digital object identifiers
      in an Electronic Finding Aid to the actual digital object in another Class.</p>
    <p>IDRESOLVER is the combination of a data table and a CGI. The table stores
      IDs and URLs, and the CGI responds to requests for ID resolution. It is
      also possible to skip the CGI and query the table directly, and some of
    the Classes take this approach. </p>
    <p>The MySQL table in the DLXS database is named &quot;idresolver&quot;. It has
    three fields: id, url, and modified. IDs must be unique. </p>
    <p>The IDRESOLVER
        CGI ($DLXSROOT/cgi/i/idresolver/idresolver) will return a single URL
      (wrapped in XML) when given an ID that is in the database. </p>
    <p>Below is an example from the <a href="http://images.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?c=bhl" target="_blank">Bentley
        Image Bank</a>, which links from a digital
      image record in Image Class to the Bentley Electronic Finding Aid (in FindAid
        Class) using IDRESOLVER. It is also possible to link in the other direction,
        but this way is easier to explain and understand. </p>
    <p>The <a href="http://images.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?rgn1=bhl_href;med=1;c=bhl2ic;q1=awm00096;back=back1183735019;size=20;subview=detail;resnum=1;view=entry;lastview=thumbnail;cc=bhl2ic;entryid=x-awm00096;viewid=AWM00096" target="_blank">image
    record</a> has a field named &quot;Finding Aid&quot; containing an ID. The
    field is configured (in Collmgr) so that Image Class uses 
    IDRESOLVER to turn the ID into a link. The Image Class middleware takes the
    value of the field, &quot;umich-bhl-02160&quot;, passes to IDRESOLVER in the form of
    an HTTP request, which returns the value from the URL field in IDRESOLVER.</p>
    <table width="644" height="44" border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>ID</td>
        <td>URL</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="172">umich-bhl-02160</td>
        <td width="456"><a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=bhlead;idno=umich-bhl-02160" target="_blank">http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=bhlead;idno=umich-bhl-02160</a></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The above example links to the top level of the Finding Aid.
      Going the other direction, from the finding aid to the image record in
      Image Class is more specific. The <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=bhlead;cc=bhlead;idno=umich-bhl-02160;type=simple;rgn=Entire%20Finding%20Aid;q1=NYDA.1986.004.00096;view=text;didno=umich-bhl-02160;focusrgn=C04;byte=224462" target="_blank">list
      of objects</a> in the finding aid has several links, each built by using
      IDRESOLVER to look up the URL by ID.</p>
    <p>An ID may resolve to any type of URL, for instance, one that returns a
      result set (many items) rather than a single item. In all cases, it is
      up to you to create and maintain the IDs and URLs. The IDRESOLVER table
      and and CGI do nothing to help with this. The University of Michigan keeps
      a FileMaker database of IDRESOLVER IDs and URLs. Data is periodically added,
      removed, and updated in the FileMaker database. And then as needed, the
      data is dumped out of FileMaker as XML and loaded in to MySQL, replacing
      the existing IDRESOLVER data.</p>
    <p>Here are the generic steps for loading or updating IDRESOLVER data. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Load all ID/URL pairs in to an intermediate/short term table in MySQL.</li>
      <li>Create an empty copy of the current, production, &quot;idresolver&quot; table.</li>
      <li>Transfer all IDs/URLs from the intermediate table to the <strong>copy</strong> of the
        production table. </li>
      <li>Rename the current production table, essentially taking it
        out of service. </li>
      <li>Rename the copy of the production table as 'idresolver' so that it
        becomes the production table.</li>
      <li>Test the new production table. If all is well, drop/delete the intermediate
        table and the previous production table.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Using the above method keeps the definition of the MySQL table in tact,
  including indexes. </p>
    <p>Michigan has a more <a href="http://www.umdl.umich.edu/docs/dlps/docs/id_resolver.html" target="_blank">specific
        set of instructions</a> for internal use
       that might be helpful to you in creating your own set of steps and
      instructions for updating idresolver.</p>
    <p>It is worthwhile to come up with a well defined plan for creating IDs
      so that they are unambiguous and, in particular, unique.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say you have a book in Text Class that has full color
      figures in Image Class and you want to display thumbnails for the figures
      in Text Class and link them to the full record and large image in Image
      Class. Plus, you want Image Class to link back to the page in the book.
      This requires 3 ID/URL pairs. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>ID/URL for the thumbnail image</li>
      <li>ID/URL for the full record in Image Class </li>
      <li>ID/URL for the book page in Text Class</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In order to disambiguate these related items, add to each ID a suffix
      such as &quot;rec&quot; for record and &quot;th&quot; for thumbnail. Also prefix each with
      a DLXS Class abbreviation and the collection id. The following is an ID
      for linking from Text Class to Image Class. Let's break it down because
      it is slightly counter-intuitive how it is constructed. </p>
    <p>Example ID:  ic-micounty-2911266.0001.001-P0000063.TIF-rec</p>
    <p>Assume the Text Class object (i.e., XML) contains a <strong>Text
        Class </strong>(not Image Class) collection ID,
      volume ID, and page ID. And the middleware has been configured/programmed
      to resolve IDs for this collection in order to link to Image Class. Text
      Class does not, however, know the Image Class collection ID that it needs
      to link to. Granted, this could be hardcoded into the middleware, but it
      is better to leave the Image Class collection ID out of the code and let
      IDRESOLVER take care of it. Again, we want the above Example ID to resolve
        to an Image Class URL. The counter-intuitive part is that the collection
        id is the Text Class collection ID, but we are linking to an Image Class
        collection.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the DLXS classes do not require IDs to follow a particular
      convention, but you may have to make middleware changes/overrides if you
      choose your own convention. </p>
<p>Once you have your database of IDs and URLs, you need to know how to make
      the Classes do look-ups. </p>
    <p><strong>Image Class</strong></p>
    <p>To make Image Class look up the value of a
      field as an ID, use Collmgr to turn on the &quot;idres&quot; option in any list of
      display fields such as (dfltentryflds). The field value 
      must match the ID in the IDRESOLVER table exactly. For more informatoin
      about enabling the idres option see <a href="../class/image/colldb.html" target="_blank">Image
      Class COLLDB (Collection Database) Configuration</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>FindAid Class</strong></p>
    <p>FindAid Class is coded to look up every DAO in idresolver and build a
      link if it finds the ID in the IDRESOLVER table. It uses the DAO as is.
      The method <strong>FilterAllDaos_XML</strong> in <strong>$DLXSROOT/cgi/f/findaid/FindAidClass.pm</strong>      can be overridden per collection if different behavior is needed. </p>
  <p><strong>Text Class </strong></p>
    <p>Text Class attempts to resolve all FIGURE IDs. It uses IDRESOLVER if the
      FIGURE TYPE is INLINE or THUMBAIL. IDRESOLVER lookups assume image class.
      The method <strong>GenerateExternalId</strong> in <strong>$DLXSROOT/cgi/t/text/TextClass.pm</strong> can
      be overridden per collection if different behavior is needed. </p>
  <p><strong>More Information </strong></p>
  <p>More information about subclassing can be found in the document <a href="../program/subclassing.html" target="_blank">Subclassing
    in TextClass</a>.</p>
<p>The utility script $DLXSROOT/bin/data2db.pl is useful for loading data in
  to a MySQL table and it can be subclassed for different formats.</p>
