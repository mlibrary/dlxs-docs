<P>Each collection used in the Image Services system must have a
unique abbreviation. The abbreviation is used in many places in the
system.</P>

<P>Examples:</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TBODY>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P>Unique collection abbreviation (lowercase alphabetic
         characters, only)</P>

         <P>Long collection name</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Each record must minimally have fields of the following
<B>type</B>:</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TBODY>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P>Identifier</P>
      </TD>
      <TD>
         <P>Unique identification of the record within the collection</P>
      </TD>
   </TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P>Image Filename(s)</P>
      </TD>
      <TD>
         <P>The image filename, with or without filename extensions. This may
         be a repeating field. (Not required if there are no images)</P>
      </TD>
   </TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P>Image Caption(s)</P>
      </TD>
      <TD>
         <P>Describes the specific view depicted in the image file.
         If the Image Filename field is repeating, then the Image
         Caption field(s) may be repeating also (though it is not a requirement). There may be
         multiple image caption fields. In many cases, and especially
         when there is only one image file per record, many or all of
         the fields of the record might be considered
         "caption"&#0160;fields. In such a case it usually works best
         to consider only the fields that describe the view depicted
         in the image to be caption fields. For example, a good
         caption field would be one that has data similar to "view
         from the south"&#0160;or "verso"&#0160;or "aerial view".</P>

<DIV2 ID="identifiers">
<H2>Identifiers</H2>

<P>It is important to know that there are significant limitations on
the characters that are allowed within SGML IDs. Unique record IDs in
image databases can take many different forms and include many
different characters. The Image Class transformation process
intelligently filters illegal SGML ID characters into legal logical
representations of the character in order to ensure legal SGML IDs
without hassle. For example, ampersand characters that occur in ID
data are changed to "-amp-". This can at times result in very long and
very ugly SGML IDs. The unfiltered version of the ID remains
searchable and displayable since it is also encoded in a non-ID field
in the SGML. If data is encountered that has illegal ID characters
that are not filtered properly, contact dlxs-info@umich.edu for
guidance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 ID="images">
<H2>About Images</H2>

<P>A database does not have to have digital images associated with
it. It is acceptable for a database to not have an Image Filename
field.</P>

<P>Any given record in a database may have 0, 1 or multiple image
files associated with it.</P> 



</DIV2>
<DIV2 ID="otherfields">
<H2>Other Fields</H2>

<P>Typically there are many other fields in a database. This is fine
and desired. There is no limit to the number of fields that can be
included.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 ID="fieldsnames">
<H2>Field Names</H2>

<P>There are no specifications for field names. If there is a field
called "Accession Number"&#0160;that serves the purpose of the
Identifier field type, that is all that is required. Similarly, if the
Image Filename field is called something like "filename", that is
also fine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 ID="multipleuses">
<H2>Multiple Uses</H2>

<P>In some cases a field has potential to serve multiple
requirements. In the most extreme example, a database might have just
one field, "ID". The ID might also be the Image Filename, and the
Image Caption. Of course this would not likely be very useful for
searching, but it makes the point. The more common example is where
image files are named by accession number. It is acceptable for a
single field to serve more than one of the minimal field
requirements, however it is absolutely critical for there to be no
ambiguity in the use of the field for multiple purposes. For example,
if data in an accession number field are to be used for filenames as
well, then the actual image files must be named exactly as the
accession numbers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 ID="charactersets">
<H2><A HREF="image-charconversion.xml">Character Sets</A></H2>

<P>All characters in the database must be 8-bit ISO
8859 Latin 1 characters. For some collections this may be rather
restrictive. At this time, characters that are not compliant
with the standard will be converted to "?" (a question mark character)
	  and not searchable properly. They also will not
display properly (the question mark character will display as a place holder). Some characters may slip through the filters and generate errors at the time of SGML validation, though in most cases the errors may be
ignored with the understanding that search, retrieval and display
will be affected. Sometime your only choice is to ignore the errors if it is not possible to determine what the appropriate character should be.</P>
